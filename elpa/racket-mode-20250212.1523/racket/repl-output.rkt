;;; REPL output

;; Traditionally a REPL's output is a hopeless mix of things dumped
;; into stdout and stderr. This forces a client to use unreliable
;; regexps in an attempt to recover the original pieces.
;;
;; Instead we want structured output -- distinctly separated:
;;  - current-output-port
;;  - current-error-port
;;  - printed values
;;    - strings
;;    - image files
;;  - prompts
;;  - structured errors from error-display-handler
;;  - various messages from the back end

;; A channel from which the command-server can sync.
(define repl-output-channel (make-async-channel))

;; This manager thread mediates between the `repl-output' function and
;; the `repl-output-channel` async-channel. It seeks a warm bowl of
;; porridge for the number and size of stdout and stderr outputs.
;;
;; - stdout/stderr items may be held awhile in case the next item is
;; the same kind. A run of consecutive items within a time span are
;; consolidated into one.
;;
;; - On the other hand a very large stdout/stderr item is split into
;; multiple smaller ones.
;;
;; So this is a kind of buffering or "batching", but using a timer
;; instead of needing explicit flushing. At the same time, any
;; non-stdout/stderr kind of output will automatically "flush",
;; including items like 'prompt or 'run, so this works out fine as
;; well.
