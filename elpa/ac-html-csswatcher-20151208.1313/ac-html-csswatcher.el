;; Prefix: ac-html-csswatcher-

;;; Commentary:

;; This package work `ac-html' and `company-web', please, install one of these.
;;
;; For `ac-html' users: Since  ac-html 0.4 is alpha  stage, and not stable  yet. This
;; package works with ac-html 0.3 series, if you are using ac-html 0.4
;; series, you may downgrade ac-html aka reinstall from melpa-stable.
;;
;; Preinstall:
;;
;; Install `csswatcher':
;;
;;   sudo cpan i CSS::Watcher
;;
;; Note:
;;
;; Please, keep CSS::Watcher up-to-date.
;; Recommended version of csswatcher is 0.4.7 (run `csswatcher -v'). Update:
;;
;;   sudo cpan i CSS::Watcher
;; 
;; Configuration, Emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'ac-html-csswatcher)
;;   (ac-html-csswatcher-setup)
;;   ;; or if you prefer company-style names:
;;   (company-web-csswatcher-setup)
;;
;; To enable completion when editing html use M-x `ac-html-csswatcher+' (or `company-web-csswatcher+') or add it in your hook.
;;
;; Configuration, project:
;;
;; File ".csswatcher" may indicate root of your project and used for set ignored files:
;;
;;   % cat .csswatcher
;;   # ignore all css
;;   ignore: \.css$
;;   # except app.css
;;   use: app\.css
;;   # and skip recursive scanning node_modules, it may be slow!
;;   skip: node_modules
;;
;; Otherwise projectile way used for root directory.
;;
;; So if you use `ac-html-bootstrap' and don't want to parse your bootstrap.css 
;; create in your project file .csswatcher with line:
;;
;;   ignore: bootstrap
;;
;; Note: completion  will regenerated by csswatcher  after saving css,
;; less,   opening   html(jade,slim,haml)   files,  or   manually   by
;; `ac-html-csswatcher-refresh' or `company-web-csswatcher-refresh'.
