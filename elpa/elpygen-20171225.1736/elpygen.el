;;; Commentary:
;;
;; `elpygen.el' uses the symbol name and it's arguments under point to
;; insert a method or a function stub into a suitable place. It also
;; makes sure the symbol is not already defined, and the requested
;; symbol is really a function/method call.
;;
;; To use the package just bind the main function to a suitable key:
;;
;; (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c i") 'elpygen-implement).
