;; Static analyze for PHP code using PHPStan.
;; https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan
;;
;; ## Instalation
;;
;; You need to get either the local PHP runtime or Docker and prepare for PHPStan.
;; Please read the README for these details.
;; https://github.com/emacs-php/phpstan.el/blob/master/README.org
;;
;; If you are a Flycheck user, activate it by selecting `phpstan`
;; with `M-x flycheck-select-checker'.
;;
;; ## Directory local variables
;;
;; Put the following into .dir-locals.el files on the root directory of project.
;; Each variable can read what is documented by `M-x describe-variables'.
