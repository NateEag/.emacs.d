1.1 Installation
================

Download the EditorConfig C Core
(https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c) and follow the
instructions in the README and INSTALL files to install it.

   This plugin also has a built-in core library implemented in
Emacs-Lisp, and fallback to it when no core executable is found.

   In either case, copy '.el' files in this repository to
'~/.emacs.d/lisp' and add the following to your '~/.emacs' file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
(require 'editorconfig)
(editorconfig-mode 1)

   Alternatively, you can find the package available on MELPA
(https://melpa.org/#/editorconfig) and MELPA Stable
(https://stable.melpa.org/#/editorconfig) (The Marmalade package
(http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/editorconfig) is deprecated).

   Or if you use *use-package*
(https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UsePackage):

(use-package editorconfig
  :ensure t
  :config
  (editorconfig-mode 1))

1.2 Supported properties
========================

Current Emacs plugin coverage for EditorConfig's properties
(https://editorconfig.org/#supported-properties):

   * 'indent_style'
   * 'indent_size'
   * 'tab_width'
   * 'end_of_line'
   * 'charset'
   * 'trim_trailing_whitespace'
   * 'insert_final_newline = true' is supported
   * 'insert_final_newline = false' is not enforced (as in trailing
     newlines actually being removed automagically), we just
     buffer-locally override any preferences that would auto-add them to
     files '.editorconfig' marks as trailing-newline-free
   * 'max_line_length'
   * 'file_type_ext' (Experimental)
   * 'file_type_emacs' (Experimental)
   * 'root' (only used by EditorConfig core)

   Not yet covered properties marked with over-strike - pull requests
implementing missing features warmly welcomed!  Typically, you will want
to tie these to native functionality, or the configuration of existing
packages handling the feature.

   As several packages have their own handling of, say, indention, we
might not yet cover some mode you use, but we try to add the ones that
show up on our radar.  Similarly, we don't yet hook in to all different
packages for whitespace trimming to inform them about editorconfig
settings, but aim for better coverage of things like ws-trim
(ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/emacs/ws-trim.el).

1.2.1 File Type
---------------

This plugin has experimental supports for 'file_type_ext' and
'file_type_emacs', which specify "file types" for files.  As for Emacs,
it means 'major-mode' can be set.

   *file_type_ext* When it is set to 'md' for 'a.txt', for example,
'major-mode' will be decided as if the file name would be 'a.txt.md'
(and thus 'markdown-mode' is likely to be used).

   *file_type_emacs* When it is set to 'markdown' for 'a.txt',
'markdown-mode' will be enabled when opening 'a.txt'.

   These property are experimental and their meanings might change in
the future updates.  When both are specified, 'file_type_ext' takes
precedence.

File: editorconfig.info,  Node: editorconfig-after-apply-functions,  Next: editorconfig-hack-properties-functions,  Up: Customize

1.3.1 'editorconfig-after-apply-functions'
------------------------------------------

(Formerly 'editorconfig-custom-hooks')

   A list of functions after loading common EditorConfig settings, where
you can set some custom variables or overwrite existing properties.

   For example, 'web-mode' has several variables for indentation offset
size and EditorConfig sets them at once by 'indent_size'.  You may want
to stop indenting only blocks of 'web-mode': it can be achieved by
adding following to your init.el:

(add-hook 'editorconfig-after-apply-functions
  (lambda (hash) (setq web-mode-block-padding 0)))

   You can also define your own custom properties and enable them here.

1.3.2 'editorconfig-hack-properties-functions'
----------------------------------------------

A list of function to alter property values before applying them.

   These functions will be run after loading ".editorconfig" files and
before applying them to current buffer, so that you can alter some
properties from ".editorconfig" before they take effect.

   For example, Makefiles always use tab characters for indentation: you
can overwrite "indent_style" property when current 'major-mode' is a
'makefile-mode' with following code:

(add-hook 'editorconfig-hack-properties-functions
          '(lambda (props)
             (when (derived-mode-p 'makefile-mode)
               (puthash 'indent_style "tab" props))))


File: editorconfig.info,  Node: editorconfig-indentation-alist,  Next: editorconfig-exec-path,  Prev: editorconfig-hack-properties-functions,  Up: Customize

1.3.3 'editorconfig-indentation-alist'
--------------------------------------

Alist of indentation setting methods by modes.

   For the easiest case to add a new support for a major-mode, you just
need to add a pair of major-mode symbol and its indentation variables:

(add-to-list 'editorconfig-indentation-alist
  ;; Just an example, of course EditorConfig has already included this setting!
  '(c-mode c-basic-offset))

   You can also modify this variable with the command M-x
customize-variable [RET] editorconfig-indentation-alist [RET]. For a bit
more complicated cases please take a look at the docstring of this
variable.


File: editorconfig.info,  Node: editorconfig-exec-path,  Next: editorconfig-get-properties-function,  Prev: editorconfig-indentation-alist,  Up: Customize

1.3.4 'editorconfig-exec-path'
------------------------------

String of 'editorconfig' executable name (command name or full path to
the executable).


File: editorconfig.info,  Node: editorconfig-get-properties-function,  Prev: editorconfig-exec-path,  Up: Customize

1.3.5 'editorconfig-get-properties-function'
--------------------------------------------

Function to use to get EditorConfig properties.

   For example, if you always want to use built-in core library instead
of any EditorConfig executable to get properties, add following to your
init.el:

(set-variable 'editorconfig-get-properties-function
              #'editorconfig-core-get-properties-hash)

   Possible known values are:

   * 'editorconfig-get-properties' (default)
        * Use 'editorconfig-get-properties-from-exec' when
          'editorconfig-exec-path' executable is found, otherwise use
          'editorconfig-core-get-properties-hash'

   * 'editorconfig-get-properties-from-exec'
        * Get properties by executing EditorConfig executable specified
          in 'editorconfig-exec-path'

   * 'editorconfig-core-get-properties-hash'
        * Always use built-in Emacs-Lisp implementation to get
          properties
