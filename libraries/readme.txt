In this directory, we keep third-party libraries that my Emacs setup depends on.

There are a few that need to be installed at site level:

-pymacs-0.23

 and some that must be pulled from version control and installed at site level:

-rope bleeding edge (http://bitbucket.org/agr/rope/)
-ropemacs bleeding edge (http://bitbucket.org/agr/ropemacs/)
-ropemode bleeding edge (http://bitbucket.org/agr/ropemode/)

The others actually live in here.

(I'm not quite sure what I mean when I say "library" - keep in mind I've never taken emacs very seriously. I suspect I refer to third-party packages that aren't just modes.)
