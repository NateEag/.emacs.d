In this directory, we keep third-party libraries that my Emacs setup depends on.

There are a few that need to be installed at site level, and these I just keep tarballs of.

The others actually live in here.

(I'm not quite sure what I mean when I say "library" - keep in mind I've never taken emacs very seriously. I suspect I refer to third-party packages that aren't just modes.)
