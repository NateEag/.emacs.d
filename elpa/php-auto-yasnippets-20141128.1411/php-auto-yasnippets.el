;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides a function that automatically creates
;; snippets for PHP standard library functions, for use with the
;; YASnippets package, available at:
;;
;;     https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet
;;
;; This package also requires php-mode, available at:
;;
;;     https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode
;;
;; To use php-auto-yasnippets you need to do three things.  First,
;; place the package in your load-path (`C-h v load-path' for help)
;; and load it from your Emacs configuration file by adding:
;;
;;     (require 'php-auto-yasnippets)
;;
;; Second, make sure the variable `php-auto-yasnippet-php-program'
;; points to the program `Create-PHP-YASnippet.php'.  That PHP program
;; should have come with this package; if you do not have it then you
;; can get it from the project GitHub URL at the top of this file.  By
;; default this package looks for the PHP program in the same
;; directory as this Elisp file.  You can use `setq' in your
;; configuration file to set the variable to the proper path if the
;; PHP program is in a different directory, e.g:
;;
;;     (require 'php-auto-yasnippets)
;;     (setq php-auto-yasnippet-php-program "~/path/to/Create-PHP-YASnippet.php")
;;
;; Finally, bind the function `yas/create-php-snippet' to a key of
;; your choice.  Since this package requires php-mode, and since it is
;; most useful when writing PHP code, you may want to use a
;; key-binding that only works when using php-mode.  For example:
;;
;;     (define-key php-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-y") 'yas/create-php-snippet)
;;
;; Now if you type the name of a PHP function and press `C-c C-y' it
;; will expand into a snippet containing all of the parameters, their
;; names, any default values, et cetera.  If you type the name of a
;; method then you need to tell the package the name of the class that
;; implements that method, otherwise it will not be able to create the
;; snippet.  Using the prefix command, e.g. `C-u C-c C-y', prompts for
;; the class name in the minibuffer.



;;; Code:

(require 'thingatpt)
(require 'php-mode)
(require 'yasnippet)
(eval-when-compile
  (when (locate-library "auto-complete")
    (require 'auto-complete)))

;;; This section defines constants the package uses as well as any
;;; global variables which the user may wish to change.

(defconst php-auto-yasnippet-version "2.3.1"
  "The version number for the php-auto-yasnippet package.")

(defvar php-auto-yasnippet-php-program
  (let ((current (or load-file-name (buffer-file-name))))
    (expand-file-name "Create-PHP-YASnippet.php" (file-name-directory current)))
  "The path to the program `Create-PHP-YASnippet.php'.")

;;; We use this variable to restrict the effects of the
;;; payas/remove-extra-whitespace function.  YASnippets lets us assign
;;; a hook to run after the expansion of each snippet.  We use that
;;; payas/remove-extra-whitespace hook to get rid of extra whitespace
;;; from the PHP snippets this package creates.
;;;
;;; However, the problem is we install payas/remove-extra-whitespace
;;; as a hook for YASnippets to execute after expanding *any* snippet.
;;; That means our function runs for snippets that have absolutely
;;; nothing to do with this package or PHP.  This is undesirable
;;; because our hook could mess up the behavior of other snippets by
;;; erroneously 'cleaning up' their whitespace.
;;;
;;; Ideally we only want YASnippets to run our hook if we are
;;; expanding a snippet created by this package.  To achieve this we
;;; use this php-auto-yasnippet-executing variable.  We set the
;;; variable to true inside of the primary public API function:
;;; yas/create-php-snippet, i.e. when the user generates a snippet
;;; with this package.  Then the payas/remove-extra-whitespace hook
;;; will test for this variable; if it has a true value, meaning we
;;; just ran yas/create-php-snippet, then the hook will perform its
;;; clean-up and then set the variable back to a nil value so that our
;;; hook only takes effect once after each call to
;;; yas/create-php-snippet.
;;;
;;; The ultimate effect is that payas/remove-extra-whitespace only
;;; affects snippets expanding via yas/create-php-snippet, limiting
;;; the hook's behavior to snippets this package creates.
