                 Checklist for New MMM Mode Releases

0. Test all new code, under all Emacsen if possible.  Check that the
   package builds and installs.

1. Check everything into Git.

2. Update the NEWS and TODO files and any other commentary files and
   check them into Git.

3. Update version numbers and dates in `mmm-mode.el', `configure.in',
   `mmm-vars.el', and `version.texi' (the latter by running `make').
   Check them in with comment "Released x.x.x".

4. Make a Git snapshot (`C-x v s') of the MMM Mode directory.  This is
   the point at which a release becomes official.

5. Run `make dist' and upload the tarball.  Upload to SourceForge.

                             Adding Files

To add a file to the distribution, edit `Makefile.am' and add it to
lisp_LISP (if an .el file) or EXTRA_DIST (otherwise).  If necessary,
add autoloads for functions or submode classes to `mmm-auto.el'.
