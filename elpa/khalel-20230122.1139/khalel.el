;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Khalel provides helper routines to import current events from a local
;;  calendar through the command-line tool khal into an org-mode file. Commands
;;  to edit and to capture new events allow modifications to the calendar.
;;  Changes to the local calendar can be transfered to remote CalDAV servers
;;  using the command-line tool vdirsyncer which can be called from within
;;  khalel.
;;
;;  First steps/quick start:
;;  - install, configure and run vdirsyncer
;;  - install and configure khal
;;  - customize the values for capture file and import file for khalel
;;  - call `khalel-add-capture-template' to set up a capture template
;;  - import events through `khalel-import-events',
;;    edit them through `khalel-edit-calendar-event' or create new ones through `org-capture'
;;  - consider adding the import org file to your org agenda to show current events there
;;
