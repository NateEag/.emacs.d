(defvar racket-hash-lang-module-language-hook nil
  "Hook run when the module language changes.

Typically in Emacs each language gets its own major mode. As a
result, the major mode hook is your opportunity to express
preferences. However `racket-hash-lang-mode' handles radically
different kinds of hash langs in one major mode. And a given
buffer can change langs when you edit the \"#lang\" line. As a
result, `racket-hash-lang-mode-hook' is not useful for per-lang
configuration. Instead you need a kind of \"sub major mode
hook\". This is that hook.

The hook is run when a file is first visited, and thereafter
whenever the \"#lang\" line is edited -- provided that results in
different language info; for example changing from \"#lang
racket\" to \"#lang racket/base\" will /not/ run the hook.

The function is called with a string returned by the lang's
\"module-language\" info key. This info key is supplied
automatically when a language is defined using
syntax/module-reader:

  <https://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/reader-helpers.html#%28mod-path._syntax%2Fmodule-reader%29>.

Otherwise a lang might not supply this and the value will be nil.

The hook is useful when you want to vary Emacs behavior in ways
that go beyond what a lang can describe. This may include
enabling \"fancy\" or \"classic\" Emacs behaviors only for
s-expression langs.

For example, maybe you want to use `paredit-mode' when it is
suitable for the module language:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun my-hook (module-language)
    (let ((rackety
           (member module-language
                   (list \"racket\" \"racket/base\"
                         \"typed/racket\" \"typed/racket/base\"))))
      (if rackety
          (paredit-mode 1)
        (paredit-mode -1))))
  (add-hook \\='racket-hash-lang-module-language-hook #\\='my-hook)
#+END_SRC

A similar tactic can be used for `smartparens' or
`electric-pair-mode'. In general, none of these
delimiter-matching modes is likely to work well unless the
hash-lang uses racket for drracket:grouping-position, in which
case `racket-hash-lang-mode' uses the classic `racket-mode'
syntax-table for the buffer. Otherwise you should not enable one
of these modes, and instead just use the simple delimiter
matching built into `racket-hash-lang-mode'; see
`racket-hash-lang-pairs'.

As another example, if you prefer more colors than just tokens,
choices include:

- Enable `racket-xp-mode' in `racket-hash-lang-mode-hook' and in
  the module language hook locally set
  `racket-xp-add-binding-faces':

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq-local racket-xp-add-binding-faces t)
#+END_SRC

  OR

- Use some of the regexp search-based fontification from classic
  `racket-mode' for rackety module languages:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require \\='racket-font-lock)
  (if rackety
      (font-lock-add-keywords nil
                              (append racket-font-lock-keywords-2
                                      racket-font-lock-keywords-3))
    (font-lock-remove-keywords nil
                               (append racket-font-lock-keywords-2
                                       racket-font-lock-keywords-3)))
#+END_SRC
")

The only syntax categories in this table are whitespace,

other syntax are changed to symbol syntax.

For example we change all string-quote syntax to symbol, because
the chars used to delimit strings vary among programming
languages. Although that example happens to be the only practical
difference from `standard-syntax-table', today, we still make a
generalized pass over it to be sure.

Note: Open/close paren syntax is preserved on the theory that,
although the /meaning/ of those characters may vary among langs,
their use as paired delimiters is likely universal, and it is
useful to support various Emacs features such as
rainbow-delimiters.

Note: `standard-syntax-table' is a better choice for spans lexed
as \"text\" tokens, because ?\" is definitely a string delimiter
in English.")

  "Use color-lexer, indent, and navigation supplied by a #lang.

An experimental major mode alternative to `racket-mode' for
source file edit buffers.

In your Emacs configuration, you may want to update the
variable `auto-mode-alist' to use `racket-hash-lang-mode' for
file extensions like \".rkt\", \".scrbl\", and/or \".rhm\".

Languages supply colors for lexer tokens like strings and
comments; see the customization variable
`racket-hash-lang-token-face-alist'. For more colors see the hook
variable `racket-hash-lang-module-language-hook', which can also
be used to vary configurations per language.
