flymake-cursor.el
=================

This project is a plugin for Emacs to work in conjunction with flymake.el
it displays any flymake error for the current line on the minibuffer.

The project is a fork of http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/flymake-cursor.el

It adds the following features:

 * Customizable delay before the error appears in the minibuffer.
 * Customizable number of errors to display in the minibuffer.
 * Does not overwrite the minibuffer if it's currently in use for user input.
 * Updates message area more consistently as flymake changes state.
 * Turns off when flymake-mode is turned off.
 * Now operates as a minor-mode of its own so you can turn on and off directly.
 * Requires flymake, ensuring a clean byte-compile.

INSTALLATION
------------

Place `flymake-cursor.el` within your Emacs `load-path` and the following to your
`.emacs` file or your `init.el`:

```lisp
(eval-after-load 'flymake '(require 'flymake-cursor))
```

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------

You can customize the behaviour of `flymake-cursor.el` with the
`flymake-cursor` group in customize mode, or you can edit the
following custom variables directly:

 * `flymake-cursor-error-display-delay` sets the delay before an error is
   displayed in the minibuffer.
 * `flymake-cursor-number-of-errors-to-display` sets how many errors to
   display in the minibuffer at once.
 * `flymake-cursor-auto-enable` sets whether flymake-cursor should
   automatically enable itself whenever flymake is enabled.
