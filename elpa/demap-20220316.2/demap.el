;;; Commentary:
;;
;; this package adds a minimap that shows a zoomed out view of the active window's
;; buffer. you can toggle showing the minimap in a side window with
;; `demap-toggle'.
;;
;; this package has a few advantages over other minimap packages.
;; - support for detaching minimaps and having them on a different frames then the
;;      active window.
;; - support for multiple minimap buffer, with there own buffer local definitions
;;      on what buffers it can show and how to show them.
;; - person preference, but having the minimap on the side of the frame rather
;;      then on the side of the active window by default.
;;
;; see the README for more information on the demap package and customization
;; options.
