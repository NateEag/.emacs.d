# When writing project-specific shell scripts, it's often handy to get
# an absolute path to the script's containing dir (in a
# well-structured project, usually the bin/ dir).
#
# Keep in mind that due to hardlinks, there is no such thing in a Unix
# system as *the* absolute path to a file, as there may be more than
# one. In most cases, that distinction is pedantry, but it can
# occasionally matter.
