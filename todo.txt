- Figure out why my magit setup is slow and get it fast. Doom Emacs has showed
  me there's no reason for it not to be greased lightning in my repos.
  new-init.el has none of my custom setup for it yet and magit runs nice and
  snappy. Guess I can start moving it towards doing what I want and see when it
  starts bogging down. Looks like magit-delta may be contributing, which seems
  to be stalled at "...probably it's the overlays?" for years now:
  https://github.com/dandavison/magit-delta/issues/9 Someone seems to have come
  up with a workaround just lately (apparently magit-delta never cleans up its
  overlays, and the workaround just shoves doing so into a magit hook):
  https://github.com/dandavison/magit-delta/issues/9#issuecomment-3252826580

- Get js2-concat-multiline-strings to always be false in NodeJS projects. I
  might conceivably want it in projects with stringent backwards compatibility
  standards for browsers, but any Node version I'll be using will have template
  literal support.

- Work around or file a bug report for package-quickstart-refresh crashing when
  a package's autoload files have been deleted. It assumes they'll all exist,
  which seems like an invariant it should ensure as needed. The error
  message was "wrong type argument: stringp, nil".

- Get lsp-mode not to interfere with the flycheck-checkers I've configured
  manually (e.g. in sh-mode I'm no longer getting shellcheck reports). That
  might be due to lsp-mode setting flycheck-checker itself, which apparently it
  does.

- Integrate
  [emacs-bash-completion](https://github.com/szermatt/emacs-bash-completion)
  into my sh-mode config, so I get tab-completion for CLI tool options. I was
  typing, realized this ought to exist, did a quick search, and found that sure
  enough it does.

- Remove my dumb hacks to try to start evil-mode in the desired state and
  instead use the supported mechanisms to choose initial state
  (evil-*-state-modes, evil-buffer-regexps). The code to rip out is added to
  evil-local-mode-hook in config-packages.el. Note that
  after-change-major-mode-hook might be where I could install hooks to make
  intelligent guesses about initial-state, as long as they run after
  evil-mode's own initial-state logic (or replace it for given buffers) - it
  should be possible to do things like check buffer contents there, making it
  possible to start with insert-state if the file's empty but normal-state if
  it's not, or to use normal-state in a COMMIT_EDITMSG buffer if there are
  non-commented non-empty lines (i.e. we're editing a pre-existing message) but
  insert-state but if there are not (a brand-new commit message).

- Make my '<leader> g d' binding put evil-mode into insert-state, as in many
  cases I'll just want to quit after seeing what I wanted to, and being in
  normal-state makes that two keystrokes instead of one. Turns out this should
  be easy to do - just add the appropriate mode to evil-insert-state-modes or
  else match buffer name using evil-buffer-regexps.

- Find some good tools for interacting with MongoDB. ob-mongo looks useful for
  doing one-off analyses: https://github.com/krisajenkins/ob-mongo

- Add do-at-point package and configure my programming modes to use it for
  "grab hyperlink to file in git forge" / "grab hyperlink to commit in git
  forge", as well as "follow hyperlink", "find file", maybe "jump to def", etc?
  Might be trying to overkill - just seemed like an interesting thought.

- Find k8s/Helm tooling for Emacs. Need a language server and/or yaml-lsp
  plugin for Helm/k8s files. https://github.com/TxGVNN/emacs-k8s-mode, maybe
  parts of https://github.com/techniumlabs/ecloud, possibly adapt
  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools
  to use its backend tools within Emacs. Get chart-testing tool (binary named
  `ct`) integrated for linting Helm files.

- Update Emacs conf to use xref-find-definitions-other-window for first jump to
  def, then to stay in that window for successive jumps. That's usually what I
  want.

- Figure out why // eslint-disable-next-line comments aren't being respected in
  Emacs even though they are by 'npm run lint' in projects at $DAYJOB. Probably
  has to do with using nts-scripts for 'npm run lint'.

- Replace Tern.js with the Typescript language server - by all accounts it does
  quite well with JS and of course it gives you TypeScript intelligence too. I
  suppose I'd get free basic typechecking in all JS I write, now that I type
  that...

- Try Jinx + libenchant + aspell for spellchecking. I really don't often need
  spellchecking anywhere except the current view, so it sounds worthwhile.

- Split my personal aspell wordlist out into a few different wordlists, so I
  can distinguish between things like 'technical abbreviations', 'personal
  terminology', etc. I thought this meant a lot of low-level fiddling, but I
  was wrong - aspell has --add-extra-dicts and --lset-extra-dicts options that
  can be used to add several dicts. Thus, implementing this is, theoretically,
  a Simple Matter of Code. See commented code in prog-mode-hook for notes on
  what a POC might require.

- Find reproduction for issue where beacon-mode flickers in the wrong position
  (something to do with having the same buffer displayed in multiple windows,
  IIRC)

- Teach magit to open buffers from magit-status in the other window in a frame,
  if another one's available.

- Figure out how to signal git-gutter buffers to update after a magit
  operation causes them to be out-of-date

- Fix aggressive-fill-paragraph mode's "only fill
  inside comments" behavior. See afp-mode-comment-bug.md for details.

- Find a way to toggle comment types. c-toggle-comment-style seems like it's
  supposed to do this job, at least in c-mode, but it didn't

- Try using recommendations at https://ianyepan.github.io/posts/emacs-ide/ for
  how to configure lsp-mode.

- Add a project-search feature whereby after a regular search, you can expand
  the search to also apply to all locally-fetched, unmerged, recently-modified
  branches. Sometimes I see stuff in code review, think it's available, then
  discover it hasn't merged yet, and it's annoying to have to grovel through
  hunting it down.

- Add a project-search feature whereby after a regular search, I can expand the
  search to include history (be nice to stream the results in as they arrive
  and keep the interaction working, so I can pause/stop the search by jumping
  to a hit).

- Add a project-search feature whereby after a regular search, I can expand the
  search to include search results from the project's forge (GitHub, GitLab,
  etc). It's often a useful way to dig up related issues, relevant PRs, and the
  like - things that may not be in the local project history.

- Get counsel-dash installed and get a baseline set of docs configured with it
  and under version control. Being able to search project docs rapidly from my
  editor for my core tools sounds lovely - use docs search to figure out the
  main API I'm looking for, then use LSP autocomplete to explore its details.
  https://github.com/dash-docs-el/counsel-dash

- Install mode-minder, because it might occasionally be handy for getting the
  overview of all my installed modes: https://github.com/jdtsmith/mode-minder

- Pick a todo.txt mode to use. I have two installed right now and they
  conflict.

- Install and configure gmch, so Emacs can garbage-collect while I'm not
  actively doing things. Seems like a better state of affairs to me.
  https://gitlab.com/koral/gcmh

- Move to [site-lisp](https://git.sr.ht/~pkal/site-lisp) package for
  autoloading my site-lisp directory. I've been meaning to do something like it
  for years now.

- Try libvterm for in-Emacs terminals. I've heard rave reviews. ...though now
  that I've discovered cool-retro-term I don't know that I'll ever be able to
  give up its awesome look-and-feel.

- Set mode-line-compact to t

- Replace my yes-or-no-p alias with use-short-answers

- Replace emojify-mode with Emacs 28.1's built-in emoji support? Supposed to
  work automatically if you have "Noto Color Emoji" installed

- Add opt-in support for aggressive-filling multiline strings in languages with
  support for it (bash, JS, Python are the obvious ones, though PHP's heredoc
  strings would also qualify).

- Check out the code-compass package. Supposed to provide automated inline
  analysis of code complexity and dependency depth... sounds interesting.

- See if I should set file-preserve-symlinks-on-save

- Consider turning on help-enable-symbol-autoload. Upside: autoloaded functions
  will always have docs. Downside: might get side effects from loading files
  just to know what something is.

- Give code-review package a test run. I could see advantages to being able to
  review in Emacs; it'd be awesome to be able to do things like jump straight
  to the file in question to get a closer look at what's going on.

- Try "emacs -f message-mailto %u" to make Emacs a mailto handler? or
  "emacsclient -e '(message-mailto "%u")'" . How does that work on OS X?

- Snag and adapt
   https://takeonrules.com/2020/11/11/synchronizing-osx-terminal-and-emacs-dark-light-appearance/
  for my own config.

- Consider whether it's worth moving from projectile to the built-in project?

- Add wgrep-ag to my setup so global find-and-replace can be massively easier.

- integrate tzc into my workflows; it's a timezone converter that might be more
  useful than the CLI one I hacked up.

- Try out async-backup? Maybe it would be superior to my hand-rolled backup on
  save? It claims that backup-on-save is slow by default, but I can't claim
  I've ever noticed that...

- Get smart-dash-mode compatible with evil-mode's replace mode (R from normal
  mode). Right now when I type a dash in replace mode it inserts it rather than
  replacing the next character.

- Bind C-k to previous result in ivy buffer switching. Make sure I'm taking the
  right approach to general ivy-based keybinds, as it works in projectile file
  search, but not in buffer switching.

- Add an evil-mode textobject for comments. I've wanted this so many times and
  I find it hard to believe it doesn't exist.

- Add a vim textobject for URL. I attempted this as ne/textobj-url, but it
  definitely doesn't work. Gotta understand evil-define-text-object better, I
  think? The issue here may have just been a poor keybinding - should take like
  5 minutes to look more closely.

- Submit bugfix for notmuch-address-selection-function upstream. See my
  override of notmuch-address-selection-function in
  site-lisp/config-packages.el.

- Apply the advice in
  https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/faq.org#how-does-doom-start-up-so-quickly
  to my config. It looks like the Doom Emacs maintainer has taken the time to
  figure out all the things I've thought about trying but have not actually
  done (like loading packages only on demand, but preloading big packages in
  the background on idle, so your idle time is used intelligently).

- Figure out how to keep moving the cursor snappy when lsp-ui mode is running.
  At least in yaml-mode when I'm hacking Ansible, the cursor gets painfully
  unresponsive while it's running, but as soon as I turn it off it's reasonable
  again.

- Set up jinja-mode to auto-apply to files with /templates/ in the path, cause
  it's probably an Ansible template if that shows up

- Try skerrick-mode next time I'm working in NodeJS server code. It's an alpha
  version of a package that aims to make NodeJS dev more like writing Emacs
  Lisp. Installed but not configured.

- Remember that I have / add a keybinding for eslint-disable-rule? I'm not sure
  how often I'll really use it, but it's a nice idea. Wouldn't mind having some
  generalized "perma-ignore next error" behavior like this that ties into
  flycheck or flymake, really...

- Try frontmacs-javascript as a possible new JS mode. Installed but not
  configured.

- Try Serenata as a new PHP intelligence engine. See how it compares to
  php-language-server. Seems to be more maintained, at least.
  https://serenata.gitlab.io/

- Try phpactor as a new PHP intelligence engine. See how it compares to
  php-language-server and Serenata.

- Teach Emacs to automatically change its theme when OS X changes between light
  and dark modes. I have a function to choose theme correctly,
  ne/set-theme-to-match-system-theme, but I don't have a way to detect the
  event. I could poll, but that's needless waste. I could also turn off OS X's
  automatic theme picker and manually specify which mode I want via Hammerspoon
  binding or similar.

- Figure out how to sustainably and permanently fix string-edit-at-point in
  json-mode. When editing JSON, you really don't want string concatenation, as
  it doesn't support it. Bug report + suggested fix:
  https://github.com/magnars/string-edit.el/issues/15

- Look into using tree-sitter to drive syntax coloration in Emacs. I've
  installed the relevant packages but it will require a lot more than just
  that. I know php-mode has a long history of slow syntax coloration and having
  a hard time keeping up with the latest PHP syntax changes, so it might be
  worth starting there. Might also be helpful for yaml-mode's difficulties in
  syntax coloration: https://github.com/ikatyang/tree-sitter-yaml

- Try evil-tree-edit, which uses tree-sitter to offer syntactically-aware
  editing for non-lisps. Think paredit/lispy/smartparens, but with an actual
  syntax tree for any supported language. tree-edit is a sibling package
  apparently aimed more at refactoring.

- Keep a history of caught spelling errors, so I can correct words I get wrong
  regularly. This is really a spellchecker feature request, not an Emacs thing,
  but Emacs is mostly where I use my spellchecker.

- Get aggressive-fill-paragraph-mode working in php-mode without horrible
  slowdowns when typing multiline comments (seemingly due to buffer indent
  attempts, as I see buffer indents happening after almost every keystroke).
  Looks like this may be related to c-indent-new-comment-line, which tries to
  indent and is perhaps getting invoked somehow, with php-mode being an
  extension of cc-mode. Could possibly relate to this issue as well:
  https://github.com/emacs-php/php-mode/issues/657

- Try using chemacs for managing custom environments for bug reports:
  https://github.com/plexus/chemacs

- Get aggressive-fill-paragraph-mode working in multiline strings.

- Try modern-sh's REPL (or perhaps skip straight to just using
  eval-in-repl-shell.el, which got installed as a dependency)

- Try emacs-piper for munging data from the filesystem. Different UI for
  evolving pipelines interactively, with the option to use elisp as well. Seems
  interesting (if only applicable for local desktop hacks).
  https://gitlab.com/howardabrams/emacs-piper

- Try eval-in-repl's Python and JavaScript support

- figure out workflow for evaluating code inline some writing a file (that is,
  learn how to use the elisp workflow anywhere else I can, like shell / JS /
  PHP)

- Try smerge and/or ediff for git conflict resolution UI. Also take a look at
  Apple's opendiff tool (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/16469), but pretty
  sure that's closed source and thus unsustainable. Meld
  (https://meldmerge.org/) looks like it at least gets the basics right and is
  open source.

- Try `ac-capf.el` to get auto-complete to show language server completions in
  lsp-mode. It should Just Work, as they say. Probably wouldn't get popup docs
  of any kind, but should be a pretty easy improvement.

- Try integrating web-mode-edit-element into my markup editing style, or else
  figuring out how to get smartparens slurp/barf/etc working in web-mode. If it
  works out, delete my prototypical work on making tagedit work with web-mode
  in favor of it, per this comment of mine:
  https://github.com/magnars/tagedit/pull/15#issuecomment-260336539

- Make sure I'm using the 27.1 native JSON parser for LSP backends

- Move package customizations to `early-init.el`

- Remove manual call to (package-initialize)

- Try out emacs-dashboard package

- Try out highlight-indent-guides.el

- Install visual-regexp-steroids and give it a try:
  https://github.com/benma/visual-regexp-steroids.el/

- Activate so-long-mode, as it's built-in now.

- See whether the proposed changes to timestamp format will impact my time
  logging package. format-time-string, decode-time, and time-convert are all
  noted as possibly impacted.

- There are FINALLY functions for parsing ISO 8601 formats, including durations
  and intervals. Update any of my code appropriately (see the iso8601-*
  functions for details).

- Consider whether I have a use for server-after-make-frame-hook

- Look into 'flex' completion style - add 'flex' to completion-styles if it
  seems relevant.

- Ditch fill-column-indicator package in favor of display-fill-column-indicator
  variable.

- Add font-lock-refontify to my Anki deck so I remember it exists (I rarely
  deal with font-lock code but sometimes I do wander into it)

- Make "<leader> g n" support going to the last hunk in a file and "<leader> g
  p" support going to the first hunk in a file. Feels like an off-by-one error.
  Some tinkering via debug suggests that in `git-gutter:next-hunk`, the
  calculation of the local variable real-index is wrong. Going to the previous
  hunk, it never gets down to 0, and going to the next hunk, it never gets up
  to 2. Incident count: 3

- Add function to send a "refresh browser" request to Skewer. It's handy when
  you get a document's markup mangled, and if you have sites auto-skewering
  then it's almost no friction to actually do that.

- Make git-gutter show staged changes as changed (right now they don't show up
  at all). Maybe use different colors to indicate the fact that they're staged?

- Find or create a way to detect my most common typing errors. Bonus points if
  it automatically generates typing drills to let me focus in on typos it has
  detected. I asked this question on StackExchange and have gotten only upvotes
  so far:
  https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/52948/package-to-detect-most-common-typing-mistakes

  Maybe the speed-type package would be a good starting point?
  https://github.com/parkouss/speed-type/

- Get smart-dash-mode usable in CSS. Some styles of class naming involve
  underscores, so it would be nice to have it do the right thing automatically.

- Make smart-dash-mode aware of it when I'm editing a bash variable.

- Add a customizable variable to smart-dash-mode that lists modes where
  variables start with a sigil (e.g. '$'), and in those modes no heuristic is
  necessary - if point is in a string matching \$[a-zA-Z0-9_]+, you *know* you
  should insert a _. You can maybe do smarter stuff than just that, too.

- Consider upstreaming a cleaned-up version of my smart-dash-mode hacks file?
  It's handy for bash but not sure how generally applicable it is. Teaching
  smart-dash-mode to be smarter about languages with variable sigils could be
  useful, though (especially for languages like PHP and bash where vars can be
  embedded in strings, since smart-dash-mode just turns itself off in strings).

- Add a workaround to web-mode-init so smart-dash-mode knows when we're in a
  comment.

- Fix move-current-buffer's behavior on trying to move a buffer to be a child
  of its own current path. I went for years without realizing I hadn't handled
  this case, so it's probably not worth fussing over, but it is definitely
  incorrect as-is. Rough incident dates: 2020-08-28

- Fix my C-x C-f binding to handle pasted paths with multiple slashes
  correctly.

- Consider using emacs-async to byte-compile packages on upgrade, and maybe
  also config-packages.el: https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async Be careful,
  though - there's a reason auto-compile doesn't do it, and it's probably a
  good one.

- Teach auto-compile to not get in the way when bisecting. I sometimes wind up
  in states that won't yield a working Emacs, which is kind of a pain. I might
  be able to just update/extend my `githooks/` dir and get what I need here.

- Set up lsp-latex if I ever start using LaTeX seriously.

- Try setting up dap-mode for debugging PHP, as doing so should get me close to
  debugging support for a lot of languages out of the gate and an
  ever-increasing number as time goes by: https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode

- Start using package-quickstart to speed up start times once Emacs 27.1 is
  released.

- Figure out how to make smartparens interact nicely with web-mode. '{{' and
  '{%' don't work right when both are on, but I don't see a way to ban
  multi-character sequences from smartparens, and I don't want to lose pairing
  braces in CSS and JS.

  Years later, I just realized it would help to only activate smartparens when
  I'm in JS, CSS, or a server-side language, since I'm usually writing '{{' and
  '{%' in markup, not genuine languages. Basically advise smartparens key
  handlers if you're in web-mode and only let them fire when you're not in
  markup. Note that it's only really braces I'd want to turn off pairing for -
  most other pairs don't have this issue.

- Replace my setup for echoing offscreen matching line for parens with this
  one:
    https://with-emacs.com/posts/editing/show-matching-lines-when-parentheses-go-off-screen/

- Figure out why aggressive-fill-paragraph-mode breaks lsp-mode in PHP badly. I
  can't enter spaces due to errors getting thrown saying "lsp-request: Method
  LanguageServer\Server\TextDocument::rangeFormatting() does not exist"

- Finish tweaks/submit PR for aggressive-fill-paragraph-mode.

- Update my "get git forge commit" keybinding to get URL to HEAD if point is
  not over a hash; look for/suggest as feature request in underlying library?

- Make a PR to auto-complete for supporting smart-dash-mode.

- Add function to spawn an emacs instance with my installed packages but none
  of my customizations looking at exactly the file and location I'm currently
  in. The idea is to make it easy to answer the question "Is a behavior my
  fault or is it a lower-level bug in my dependencies?"

- Use elisp-depmap to see if I can find any packages I actually don't want in
  my config.

- Try porting the Readable library to Emacs Lisp. I have yet to really
  internalize reading Emacs Lisp, and it looks promising to me:
  https://readable.sourceforge.io/

  Readable is implemented as a reader macro, it seems, and elisp does not
  support reader macros
  (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/18003/how-can-i-modify-elisps-reader),
  so this might be a dead end.

  That said, some enterprising soul *has* implemented a POC elisp reader:
  https://github.com/mishoo/elisp-reader.el

  so this may yet be achievable without hacking a lot of C.

- Go through the tools and techniques described in
  https://alphapapa.github.io/emacs-package-dev-handbook/ and adopt any that
  seem useful.

- Consider replacing Cask in my elisp package writing with Keg? Not sure I
  actually will prefer Keg, or that it will get a big enough community to stick
  around, but in principle I like reducing the number of languages I depend on.
  https://github.com/conao3/keg.el

- Try out evil-smartparens, once I'm a little more used to smartparens itself.
  Looks like it might do some neat stuff.
  https://github.com/jschaf/evil-smartparens/

- When I'm working in a NodeJS script (detectable by '#! /usr/bin/env node',
  among other approaches), js2-mode should auto-execute

  `(setq-local js2-concat-multiline-strings nil)`

  Life would be better that way.

  More generally I guess that should happen whenever it sees any JS features
  that imply backtick-strings are available. Is that ES 6?

- I just typed "element.style.display = 'hidden'" when obviously it should have
  been 'none' and wish my editor had warned me. A quick way to get this would
  be to start using TypeScript or Flow to do static checking of JS and install
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/csstype with it.

- Look at using lsp-html with web-mode. See what it might buy me.

- Try out literate-elisp for one of my packages, largely as an experiment in
  literate programming: https://github.com/jingtaozf/literate-elisp

- Write a macro to eval a block of elisp and query for value of any undefined
  variables, then bind it to a key. It would be useful when debugging defuns.

- Play with ob-html-chrome. It sounds like it could be a useful tool for
  writing docs that embed HTML, as many people like to see what things look
  like. https://github.com/nikclayton/ob-html-chrome

- Report and/or fix bug in rainbow-mode.el - URLs with hashes and hex-like
  characters are vulnerable to false positives. https://localhost/test#debug is
  an example that gets highlighted for me as of time of writing.

  If I turn the opening character class of the first entry in
  rainbow-hexademical-colors-font-lock-keywords from '[^&]' to '[[:space:]]',
  my above URL example no longer causes trouble. No idea if that's a valid fix,
  but it's a useful data point.

  Bug report filed: https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=37681

- Generate autoloads for my mode configs (and other code I've hacked up myself)
  from autoload cookie comments, rather than maintaining them manually.
  Apparently auto-compile has `auto-compile-update-autoloads' for this purpose.
  As long as you commit those changes along with the others, that would
  probably work pretty well.

- ac-source-css-property and ac-source-css-property-names are missing a bunch of
  bleeding-edge CSS 3 stuff. Get that in there. Ideally, generated from the
  spec, along with basic docs, and adding ';' at the end of property values.

- If I ever accumulate enough feeds for it to matter, try adding elfeed-summary
  into my RSS feed workflow.

- Emacs 26: Move package config into early-init.el, per recently-landed patch
  in Emacs trunk.

- Consider using suppression functions to implement afp's fill-comments-only
  feature? I feel like it would be more robust than the current approach, but
  perhaps I'm mistaken. I also think it might solve some of my js2-mode issues,
  though I'm not sure of that (I think changing the fill function from the
  default is where they come from).

- Add afp-super-aggressive to aggressive-fill-paragraph-mode to bundle up my
  proposed changes per the maintainer's suggestion.

- Make aggressive-fill-paragraph-mode suppress auto-fill in markdown-mode code
  blocks. I thought it was supposed to, but in the traditional four-space
  indented code blocks, it doesn't seem to work for me.

- Try out prog-fill for (auto?) filling code. I've installed it but haven't
  tried to use it for anything yet.

- aggressive-fill-paragraph-mode should auto-fill after breaking a paragraph
  into two paragraphs (RET RET, basically).

- Suppress aggressive-fill-paragraph-mode while directly above or below markdown
  code blocks.

- Prevent my aggressive-fill-paragraph-mode from filling rst titles when
  deleting a preceding paragraph (and maybe just prevent it from filling
  titles in general).

- Prevent aggressive-fill-paragraph-mode from filling paragraphs that look
  hand-formatted. A decent heuristic might be "if the majority of lines are
  less than three-quarters the width of fill-column"? A better heuristic is
  probably 'Are lines other than the last one and the one before / after point
  less than three-quarters of fill-column?'

- Set up a 'Stale questions' saved search in notmuch that shows me all
  non-response emails I sent including a question mark in the body or subject
  line that have received no replies and are more than a week old. The goal is
  to have my email system let me know about threads I need to bump.

- Auto-insert basic email template after exiting "To:" field. If it contains
  one email address with the name, use first name. If it contains multiples,
  say "Hi everyone".

- Come up with a way to send emails and flag the newly-made thread as
  'watched'. Incident count: 5

- Notify me when a new email comes into a thread I'm writing a response in.
  Incident count: 1

- Use smtpmail-queue-mail and some network up/down notifier to automatically
  queue mail if offline and to automatically send it when back online.

  Update: I have just installed the 'network-watch' package from MELPA, so this
  should be just about trivial to do now. The one thing is I'd have to
  distinguish between "network is up" and "I have an internet connection",
  which the eping package might be useful for (or I could just shell out
  myself).

  Incident count: 1

- Figure out what mime-type should be used for emailing bash scripts as an
  attachment.

- Understand how text/plain email attachments get converted from just LF to
  CRLF. I suspect it's notmuch's compose mode making sure my attachment conforms
  to RFC 2046, section 4.1.1, which specifies CRLF *must* be used for text/plain
  content.

- Figure out why git-rebase-mode doesn't always have the keybindings it claims
  to. I think it happens the first time I rebase after starting Emacs, so it's
  likely an initialization problem, but I'm not really sure. I believe it's a
  question of whether evil-mode is in insert-state or not, because I have the
  logic that tries (and fails) to pick the right state based on whether a
  buffer has contents or not.

- Use gmailieer to sync notmuch tags to gmail: https://github.com/gauteh/gmailieer

- Submit PR to make flycheck-eslint-rulesdir a list.

- Get flycheck to support opening URLs for more details on errors. Sometimes
  error messages are confusing or terse but the error ID can be used to map
  directly to a documentation ID that explains the issue well.

- Add (or find) a flycheck checker for nginx config files using -t.
  https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/developer/developing.html#writing-the-checker
  explains how to do the job.

- Make js-doc use Tern (when available) to guess types for function params.

- Give kakoune.el a whirl, just to see what it's like:
  https://github.com/jmorag/kakoune.el . After reading through Kakoune's
  philosophy document, it does sound like it could be an improvement on the Vim
  experience. https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/why-kakoune.html

- Remember that HTMLize exists and I installed it. I could see it being useful
  for getting syntax coloration on static sites for obscure programming
  languages, for instance.

- Figure out a smarter way than "start Emacs from a terminal" to make
  browse-url snappy.

  If I start emacs from a Terminal prompt, opening a link is instantaneous.

  If I start it via Spotlight or my Hammerspoon binding, they're slow.

  They load the exact same set of elisp files.

  Their environments are different (determined via the `process-environment`
  variable), but I don't see any immediate smoking guns for causing this
  difference.

  For the moment I guess I'll start it from a terminal session. :/

  This didn't happen before Mojave - I wonder what changed?

  Worth noting that this may not be Emacs-specific. Opening a URL from YakYak
  the other day took a full ten seconds.

  For more verbose analysis, see this file's history.

- Add ne/yas-copy-snippet. I occasionally want to populate then copy / paste a
  snippet (often for pasting into a prompt in another system, like a bash shell
  or a browser console). It would be nice to have it be easier than it is.

- Consider trying dtache package for managing project-specific dev processes.
  It apparently uses a program to actually manage processes so that a crashed
  or killed Emacs doesn't kill the processes. Doesn't sound super-compelling to
  me but could be interesting, and maybe an alternative to the main reasons I'm
  tempted to use terminals in Emacs.

- Make the ansi-term tweaks suggested in this article:
  http://echosa.github.io/blog/2012/06/06/improving-ansi-term/

- Consider using project-shells for managing shells? I've installed it just so I
  have it around should I decide to try it.

- See how hard it would be to be content with shell-pop as my terminal manager.
  It only supports a single terminal session, and automatically changes
  directories based on the buffer you spawned it from. If I could figure out
  how to work within that constraint, it might be reasonably usable.

- I'd like to have a hotkey that brings up my most recent terminal. I'd also
  like terminal windows to always appear in a bottom window of my current
  frame, which is probably a need popwin would achieve admirably. I used to
  think I wanted something more like a tabbed terminal emulator, and maybe I
  will want some keybindings for flipping between groups of terminal buffers,
  but that's secondary to just establishing "terminal buffers get and/or create
  the bottom window". I have just installed term-projectile, which seems to
  handle the create and swap features - I just need to teach popwin how to
  force terminals to always display in the bottom half of a split panel
  properly. N.B.: shackle may be a significantly better alternative to popwin:
  https://github.com/wasamasa/shackle

- Fix my '<leader> p o f' binding. At present it doesn't really work.

- Teach js2-mode not to concatenate ES 6 backtick strings. When
  js2-concat-multiline-strings is t, newlines invoke concatenation which I
  guess could make sense if you're trying to use template strings and don't
  want any newlines in it, but what I want is for ES 5 strings to Just Work and
  for ES 6 strings to Just Work. Not sure if this should be an extension of my
  own or something that goes in the core. Until I use ES 6 more often, the
  workaround is to set that var to false when I'm actually using backtick
  strings.

- Figure out why entering '/**<RET>' in js2-mode results in a proper comment
  block if you wait a bit before pressing Enter, but a weird string
  concatenation if you press it quickly.

- Make json-mode.el print paths more minimally (use .name instead of ["name"])?
  Maybe it's that way cause it's not supported everywhere.

- Add function for injecting JS from arbitrary URL into documents.
  There's already one for using bower, but being able to just grab any URL could
  be handy, especially if you're in a locked-down environment.

- Look into integrating jscs.el with my JS editing flow. I've already installed
  the elisp library just so I have it around. I much prefer ESLint for style
  checking, but if jscs can *fix* the style failures for me, that would be quite
  nice. Note that newer ESLint versions have some support for fixing violations.

- Add tern-lint.el to my JS setup. Static type checking is a handy thing (and I
  personally find flow's comment-annotation syntax too intrusive for good
  readability).

- Report issue with Tern seeing 'this' as the global namespace in Angular
  controller functions. Controllers always have constructor semantics, and
  should be treated as such.

- Report dontLoad being overridden by loadEagerly in .tern-project. I would
  expect the opposite behavior.

- For vars that are assigned a function directly, tern should treat any
  immediately-preceding JSDoc block as being that var's JSDoc. See pick in
  lodash 4.13.1 for an example of failure.

- Add php-auto-yasnippet-style function params to tern.js.

- I'd like yasnippets for JavaScript. I don't much like the defaults.

- Report and/or fix yasnippet issue where loading js2-mode's snippets doesn't
  load its parent-mode's snippets.

- Add flycheck-css-colorguard: http://melpa.org/#/flycheck-css-colorguard

- css-mode should have working comment fill. Right now it only believes in
  single-line comments, which gets clumsy and annoying fast.

  ...it looks like someone may have actually fixed this:
  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-diffs/2015-04/msg00293.html

  Further research shows that css-fill-paragraph works, but there are two issues
  with my current setup using current css-mode:

      * RET binding does not insert the appropriate comment prefix.

        php-mode gets this right. So does c-mode. Ah, right - because php-mode is
        a big hack on top of c-mode.

        It looks like c-mode has its own function implementing the
        comment-and-newline behavior, while I'm using comment-indent-new-line.
        It works fine in most modes, but not css-mode.

        Supposedly setting 'comment-multi-line' to non-nil should solve this, but
        it doesn't.

        ...inspection via edebug suggests comment-indent-new-line is expecting
        fill-prefix to be set by adaptive-fill, but it's nil. How's that
        supposed to work?

        fill-prefix is used on the assumption that it's a normal fill-prefix,
        then a few lines later it's used as if it's chosen by adaptive-fill, but
        with no logic to actually invoke adaptive-fill.

        If I run fill-context-prefix manually on a decent-sized hunk of CSS
        comment, it returns " * ", as you'd hope.

        So how can I make that apply in this context?

      * fill-paragraph does not work correctly on a one-line paragraph that is
        wider than fill-column. It works fine in other cases, and auto-fill
        itself *does* work fine in that case.

- Maybe add ac-html-csswatcher package to my setup. Parses CSS/LESS files in your
  project to give you a class/ID ac-source when writing HTML.

- It would be awesome to have a flycheck module that gave warnings/errors based
  on (configurable) browsers you just violated support for. The caniuse data
  makes this feasible, but maybe a royal pain.

- Bind '<leader> p s' to helm-projectile-ag, with fallback to the regular grep
  command. (feature request in helm-projectile-ag?)

- Make projectile refresh cache on idle, and always use cache? I can touch
  .projectile if I want to force a refresh. Then again, this is only noticeable
  on my work machine... Enable if file listing takes more than N milliseconds?

- Replace my projectile-ag search keybinding with deadgrep? I've installed
  deadgrep and it feels sort of different but it is interesting.

- Fix ':' choking projectile grep searches on Windows.

- I would like an auto-complete source for existing files that is based on a
  per-project 'docroot/static' variable. I would like that source to be
  activated when I am working in a template and have entered an href="/..." or a
  src="/...". Actually, it might work better if it was just activated for any
  string beginning with '/'. Some hints:
  http://superuser.com/questions/67170/how-do-i-complete-file-paths-in-emacs

- Try corfu as a replacement for auto-complete. I hear some claims it's better
  than company mode.

- Figure out if the compdef package would buy me anything useful. I think it's
  for eliminating auto-complete source boilerplate from
  company-mode/completion-at-point configurations, but I might be
  misunderstanding. https://gitlab.com/jjzmajic/compdef

- I should have Twig/Django snippets. 'block' is the obvious one, but probably
  snippets for all the major bits of syntax would be handy, and someone out
  there must have written such things.

- Figure out how to run afp-fill-paragraph after kill-region *only* if the user
  called it interactively. It's often used in code which can lead to weird
  results inside comments.

- Make afp-fill-paragraph play better with <RET> <RET> in emacs lisp comments.
  The second <RET> loses the leading space, so you then have to type a space
  with something other than self-insert-function to actually make your new
  paragraph.

- Set up Elsa as an Elisp static analyzer: https://github.com/emacs-elsa/Elsa

- Try using elisp-def as an enhancement to slime-nav-mode? It's installed, just
  have to try configuring it and seeing if it makes life any better.

- Use Consolas-10 as font by default on Windows.

- Look into midi-kbd.el and lily-midi.el as an aid in creating lilypond files
  with MIDI instruments.

- Try smooth-scrolling package and see if it makes my life any better:
  https://github.com/aspiers/smooth-scrolling

- Simpler alternative to file watchers, perhaps:
  https://github.com/wasamasa/firestarter

- Get ac-isearch working when auto-completion is active. I think my
  global-set-key of C-s to regex searching currently overrides it.

- Extract jedi-force to be an ELPA package. I was thinking of adding more
  features, but it might be fine as it is.

- Integrate what's useful from spacemacs: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs
  I've got most of what I want, but evil-little-word could be nice.

- Add evil text object/motion for 'comment', 'inner comment', 'around comment',
  etc. Sometimes I find myself trying to think in those terms.

- Add a mechanism to collapse/expand all comments (and docstrings?) in a file.
  bicycle-mode is a wrapper around hs-mode that might be a starting place. I
  installed it for future reference.

- Make comment auto-fill work with C++-style comments in js2-mode, not just
  C-style. Turns out it does - it's just that js2-mode thinks single-line
  comments are only block comments if there's a trailing single-line comment. A
  better test might be "is there a preceding single-line comment". See
  js2-mode-extend-comment for the logic that would need tweaking.

- Make auto-fill apply to strings in emacs-lisp-mode. Really seems like this
  should already be happening. Dunno why it doesn't.

- Get Emacs to auto-fill with string concatenation in JS (and similar langs).
  That is, something like this
  var foo = 'foo is ' +
            'a set of ' +
            'really short strings';

  if filled, becomes

  var foo = 'foo is a set of really short strings';

- If I ever get minimap.el usable on OS X, when active it should appear between
  my two panes. That way it's always close to whichever buffer it applies to.
  Note: the sublimity package looks like it may be more maintained.

- Try out demap for minimap usage? Installed it and gave it a quick test, but
  it doesn't seem to handle window or frame management especially well in my
  setup (I'd prefer it to expand the frame by the number of columns it needs
  automatically).

- Tweak md-readme.el so that author/created/requires lines are headers *without*
  colons, whose bodies are the text following the colon-delimited field names.
  el2markdown is another package to do a similar job - maybe it's better?

- File feature request to flycheck for being able to run checkers while in
  web-mode. May well get rejected, because supporting this would be pretty hard.

- Add keybindings for scrolling completion window by a full window-ful. C-v and
  M-v are the obvious ones. Useful when you're digging through something like wx
  or the JDK looking for a class that might apply.

- Derive a lightweight envrc-mode from sh-mode and add support for
  direnv-specific things like PATH_add. Google suggests none exists.

- Make a PR to yasnippet for my solution to the 'once' snippet overriding the
  'require_once' snippet.

- Add support for a 'description' field in yasnippets. You could use that to
  drive a help popup in {auto-complete,company}-mode, which can in turn be very
  handy in languages with obscure syntax (e.g. bash) or for snippets whose
  purpose is not immediately obvious to the novice. Even cooler would be to let
  you insert snippets by searching their descriptions, a la
  https://metacode.app/.

- Find a workaround that will let me use auto-complete in a yasnippet tab
  field. A keybinding other than Tab for auto-complete would work, but it might
  be possible to bind something clever to Tab that picks which maneuver to do
  based on whether there are any characters before point *and* whether
  autocompletion has been invoked before while in this field. or something like
  that. This guy came up with a way to do it for company-mode - maybe I should
  bite the bullet and switch over...
  https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/auwzjr/comment/ehb5zxm/

- Figure out how to insert '[ | ]' in bash snippets like if when I type '['
  (where | indicates cursor position). I constantly do this little weird dance
  which I only just now realized I've been doing. Since you can escape to elisp
  easily in yasnippets, this should be perfectly possible - now is just not the
  time. Incident count: >100

- Add a command to rename a file in a project. I don't care about refactoring
  smarts (though it might be nice to offer a hook to support that), I just want
  to query/replace throughout the project for
  s/$old_relative_pathname/$new_relative_pathname/. Incident date list:
  2020-01-15

- Add a keybinding for 'rename this git-managed buffer'. Incident count: 3.
  This shouldn't be too bad - ne/yank-buffer-project-relative-path gets exactly
  the argument I want for the first param and the second one should just be the
  same interactive prompt it currently is. Alas, I don't see a way to call an
  interactive function and supply a value for one argument while having the
  interactive interface itself run for the second. It's probably possible to
  use the `interactive-form" function to do that, but it would be tricky.
  Arguably this is a feature request to magit, since I don't care for the way
  magit-file-rename works at present - I want a way to say explicitly say
  "rename the current file", so I don't have to do a redundant Enter keystroke
  after invoking the command (it shows the current buffer as the first item in
  the list [but oddly only allows you to select things nested in that buffer's
  directory, not the whole repo]).

- Think about how backup-walker, undo-tree, and magit ought to intersect,
  ideally. Really this is less about any of those packages and more about the
  theoretical interplay between version control, explicit commits, implicit
  savepoints, and an editor's in-memory undo support. Note that the
  extraordinary John Wiegley has touched on some of this in his package
  git-undo.el: https://github.com/jwiegley/git-undo-el

- Add a command to backup-walker to revert to the selected backup file. 'r'
  would be a good keybinding. If this doesn't already exist, it might make sense
  to wrap this up with my other backup settings as 'sane-autosaves'. See if
  backups-mode makes this work nicely?
  https://github.com/chadbraunduin/backups-mode

- Add a command to backup-walker to ediff against the current file.

- As a simple exercise to start learning macros, try implementing PHP's
  "defaulting" ternary operator behavior. The example I emailed myself was
  (setq (default (= 3 foo) 5)), where 'default' is the macro, presumably.

- If I ever start using multiple windows more seriously, window-numbering-mode
  might be handy. http://nschum.de/src/emacs/window-numbering-mode/

- Teach yaml-mode + lsp-mode + ansible to auto-generate a yasnippet with for
  all required fields on tabbing or autocompleting after typing a module name.
  By definition, you'll want to populate all required fields, so might as well
  just do it. This is likely mostly on the language server, with maybe a little
  editor intelligence on when to trigger it.

- Teach yaml-language-server to suggest available Ansible modules when defining
  a new task and you request completion on a blank line after the '- name: ...'
  line. It currently fails due to something being undefined, but it seems
  obvious to me this is where you put a pragmatic hack into the codebase to
  enable what people will usually want, rather than stick with purity. I know
  this is language-server-specific, because the same issue happens in Visual
  Studio Code (I downloaded it to test that).

- Define a really good ac-source for use with lsp-mode. Seems like most of what
  we need to do here could be set up generically based on the features a given
  server offers, but I suppose working on this could show me I'm wrong about
  that.

- Configure lsp-ui package to taste. I've installed it.

- Consider integrating lsp-mode with php-auto-yasnippet? May or may not be worth
  doing.

- Try adapting flymake-phpstan to work with my PHP setup. Installed the package
  so I have it if I ever have time for this again

- Get lsp-mode and php-language-server showing function summaries in minibuffer,
  not just function signatures.

- ac-php looks like it does a lot of what I'd need, as a newcomer to the party:
  https://github.com/xcwen/ac-php

- Install/configure php-scratch, as it could be handy for quick experiments.

- If I ever have to go back to programming Java, try using lsp-java with
  lsp-mode. Looks like a much better alternative to eclim, IMO, since it ties
  directly to a supported Eclipse project.

- php-mode should not move sigils when swapping words with M-t.
  $this_thing => thing_$this is not what we want.

- It would be really sweet to get yasnippet's bracket placement to do the Right
  Thing based on major-mode, placing them on the newline or on the same line
  intelligently. I'm guessing that can be achieved by applying elisp to the
  templates. This was inspired by making changes to the php-mode snippets to do
  bracket placement the way I like. Someone's done some work that was approved
  of by another guy on the yasnippet blog, and they've said any extensions would
  not be accepted into yasnippet:
  http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.yasnippet.devel/403

- The PHP function/method snippets should have a header comment by default. For
  every parameter you add, an @param line should be inserted in the header
  comment.

- Improved bash auto-complete while writing scripts would be nice, too. Search
  "$PATH" when writing commands, for instance (first word on line/first word
  inside subshells, first word in if, etc). Course, really you'd need a bash
  parser to get that right, but a handful of simple cases could probably just be
  hardcoded.

- bash snippets would be nice: https://github.com/bmaland/yasnippet-sh-mode

- Write/get a PHP snippet for array keyval. '$key’ => $val,

- Write/get a PHP snippet for constructors. Really, this should just be a part
  of a class snippet. The point is that it would save a lot of typing to have
  one in the style of the Python one, especially since args should be
  initialized at the class level.

- My SQL-in-PHP code does not work with queries that are built using
  concatenation, which some do (especially in crappy legacy codebases). See my
  email inbox for examples.

- Look into using [Tree-sitter](http://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) and
  [tree-sitter.el](https://github.com/karlotness/tree-sitter.el) to get
  parse-tree-based syntax coloration. If you did it as opt-in extensions to
  existing modes it could make life a lot better (and easier).

- Debug mmm-mode, php-mode, and sql-mode enough to uncomment my sql-mode
  embedding in php-mode. Actually, maybe just replace it with something using
  poly-mode, which seems to be much better developed in 2020.

- Consider this alternative to mmm-mode and friends: https://github.com/Fanael/edit-indirect/blob/master/edit-indirect.el

- Try integrating the fancy new SQL indentation minor-mode:
  https://github.com/alex-hhh/emacs-sql-indent

- Configure edbi to have the niceties I like (evil-local-mode and so on).

- Automate installing EDBI's CPAN dependencies (yuck) if I stick with it
  as a DB interaction UI, I suppose. Maybe just figure out how to have them all
  in my dotfiles, like I do with NodeJS modules.

- Next time I have to work against a DB server regularly, install and configure
  edbi-minor-mode: https://github.com/proofit404/edbi-minor-mode Looks like it
  should beat the pants off sql-mode, even if it does depend on Perl.

- sql-mode appears to be a far more powerful beast than I had ever really
  appreciated. I should look into setting up and learning the server
  interaction components, which could make my life so much less painful. Of
  particular note is http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SqlWithPlaceholders.

- Look into sql-mode-driven autocompletion. It might be useful.

- I would like my sql-mode to do a better job with font-lock. It does very
  poorly at dealing with strings that have backslashed quotes. Could this be
  solved by some regex-tweaking? Scuttlebutt on the net suggests that there's a
  toggleable setting.

- I should enable the rst-mode yasnippets when in rst-mode.

- Fix the issue with rst-mode not highlighting hyperlink references correctly.
  This is marked as a FIXME in rst-mode.el - search for 'Hyperlink References'.

- I'd also like context-sensitive paragraph filling. That is, in comments, my
  fill-column value is 79, but if I'm in a Python docstring, fill-column should
  be 72. Apparently this is fixed in a Jan. 2013 commit to python-mode.el.

- Figure out what the best way to save/restore my Emacs sessions is. Ideally,
  find a solution that lets me save/restore buffer state for a whole directory,
  but not for ones I haven't configured. I bet combining one of the existing
  packages with a bit of elisp and .dir-locals.el would do the job.

- Fix M-<backspace> deleting past underscores in python-mode.

- Test lsp-jedi.el to see if I'd rather use it than baseline jedi.el.

- Look into anaconda-mode. It appears to be a wrapper around Jedi that might add
  a bit more intelligence, or something? Popped up in list-packages today.

- Look into Pylance as an LSP-based alternative to Jedi. It's not open source,
  so that's a big strike against it.
  https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release

- Try out with-venv and/or pyvenv-auto in my Python config. I think one of them
  should be what I need to run things with the correct venv from within Emacs.
  I installed pyvenv-auto but haven't tried it at all.
  https://github.com/10sr/with-venv-el

- Think about whether I should pull ropemode back into python-mode; I never
  really used the refactoring tools, but maybe I should.

- Integrate elpygen into my python development workflow? I've installed it but
  haven't thought about setup at all.

- Figure out how to get ispell to not spellcheck options or command names in
  sh-mode. By itself that's easy, but you probably *do* want to spell-check
  options you're defining yourself, and that's kind of a parser-ish problem. A
  crazy alternative might be a script that builds a dictionary of all known
  command-line options on $PATH and using that dictionary for sh-derived
  modes?

- Try replacing my hand-hacked my-get-default-font-size function with the
  textsize package? I've installed it but not used it for anything yet

- Replace my hand-hacked flyspell word correction popup with this package:
  https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct

- Delete trailing whitespace *only* from comments in diff-mode.

- When I'm yanking something into an indented block, python-mode ought to assume
  that I want it indented to that block's depth and adjust the leading
  whitespace for each line accordingly. This applies to indentation in general;
  it might work in most modes, for all I know. With Python, there's the
  perennial problem of no delimiters; it's not necessarily right to go to the
  highest possible indentation on a newline. For yanking, though, I'll bet it's
  the right call most of the time. If it's not, you're just an indent command
  away from having the right depth.

- Figure out why pyimpsort.el throws an error for me. It has something to do
  with my config - emacs -Q with package set up, then requiring python-mode and
  pyimpsort works. One of my addons (possibly jedi-force?) is causing the error.

- Fix which-func-ff-hook error: (void-function py--imenu-create-index-function).
  Might be related to above - they both seem likely to involve a variable being
  defined at the wrong time.

- Frequently, especially when writing prose, I find my fingers doing the dance
  any given editor requires to swap elements in a comma-separated list. Seems
  like that shouldn't require too many keystrokes. I'm sure Emacs can do this
  with a bit of hacking, and maybe it already does...

- A minor-mode to automatically turn on Caps Lock if it seems appropriate. For
  instance, in bash the var names in an export statement should almost always
  be capitalized. Similarly constant names in many other languages (modern JS,
  C, Java, etc...). caps-lock mode
  (http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/caps-lock.html) is probably a starting place -
  just need some wrappers around it to figure out when it should be active. I'm
  not at all sure this is a good idea, though - just using Caps Lock itself
  might be a much simpler answer to this problem (it's not currently bound on
  my main keyboard).

- A mode in which English grammatical rules are automatically applied to
  anything that looks like a sentence. For instance, when I refactor a
  sentence, it ought to know that the first word gets capitalized. That might
  be the only thing I actually want, come to think of it... Looks like smeone
  may have built this: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/auto-capitalize.el

- I would like multiline comments to be hidden after the first line by default,
  with an easy way to toggle full comment display.

- I'd really like a code folding minor-mode - just lets you hide/show blocks of
  code, by saying basically "fold at this line" and "unfold at this line". I
  have started playing with hide/show mode, and it's not perfect, but it does
  more or less what I want for now. I've installed origami-mode and it works
  fine, perhaps better, for some things, but what I really want is the ability
  to fold comments and long strings, which it doesn't seem to support.

- It might be nice to store all byte-compiled files in a single byte-cache
  folder. It's probably not worth much hassle, though, since I have hooks
  generating them and they're gitignored.
