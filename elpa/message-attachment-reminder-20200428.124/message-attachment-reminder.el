;;; Commentary:

;; Scans outgoing messages via `message-send-hook' to look for phrases
;; which indicate that an attachment is expected to be present but for
;; which no attachment has been inserted.

;; The phrases to look for can be customized via
;; `message-attachment-reminder-regexp', whilst the warning message shown
;; to the user can be changed via
;; `message-attachment-reminder-warning'.

;; Finally, by default quoted lines are not checked however this can be
;; changed by setting `message-attachment-reminder-exclude-quoted' to
;; `nil'.
