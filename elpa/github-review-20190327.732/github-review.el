;;`github-review` lets you submit GitHub code review with Emacs.
;;
;; With `github-review-start` you can pull the content of a pull request into a buffer
;; as a diff with comments corresponding to the PR description.
;; In that buffer you can add comment (global and inline) that you want to make on the pull request.
;; Once done, you can submit these comments as a code review with one of:
;; - `github-review-approve`
;; - `github-review-comment`
;; - `github-review-reject`.
