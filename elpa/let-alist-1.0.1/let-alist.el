;;; Commentary:

;; This package offers a single macro, `let-alist'.  This macro takes a
;; first argument (whose value must be an alist) and a body.
;;
;; The macro expands to a let form containing body, where each dotted
;; symbol inside body is let-bound to their cdrs in the alist.  Dotted
;; symbol is any symbol starting with a `.'.  Only those present in
;; the body are let-bound and this search is done at compile time.
;;
;; For instance, the following code
;;
;;   (let-alist alist
;;     (if (and .title .body)
;;         .body
;;       .site))
;;
;; expands to
;;
;;   (let ((.title (cdr (assq 'title alist)))
;;         (.body (cdr (assq 'body alist)))
;;         (.site (cdr (assq 'site alist))))
;;     (if (and .title .body)
;;         .body
;;       .site))
;;
;; Note that only one level is supported.  If you nest `let-alist'
;; invocations, the inner one can't access the variables of the outer
;; one.

;;; Code:


(defun let-alist--deep-dot-search (data)
  "Return alist of symbols inside DATA that start with a `.'.
Perform a deep search and return an alist where each car is the
symbol, and each cdr is the same symbol without the `.'."
  (cond
   ((symbolp data)
    (let ((name (symbol-name data)))
      (when (string-match "\\`\\." name)
        ;; Return the cons cell inside a list, so it can be appended
        ;; with other results in the clause below.
        (list (cons data (intern (replace-match "" nil nil name)))))))
   ((not (listp data)) nil)
   (t (apply #'append
        (remove nil (mapcar #'let-alist--deep-dot-search data))))))

;;;###autoload
(defmacro let-alist (alist &rest body)
  "Let-bind dotted symbols to their cdrs in ALIST and execute BODY.
Dotted symbol is any symbol starting with a `.'.  Only those present
in BODY are let-bound and this search is done at compile time.

For instance, the following code

      .site))"
