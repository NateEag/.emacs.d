;;; Commentary:

;; If you have lots of keybindings set in your .emacs file, it can be hard to
;; know which ones you haven't set yet, and which may now be overriding some
;; new default in a new Emacs version.  This module aims to solve that
;; problem.
;;
;; Bind keys as follows in your .emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'bind-key)
;;
;;   (bind-key "C-c x" 'my-ctrl-c-x-command)
;;
;; If you want the keybinding to override all minor modes that may also bind
;; the same key, use the `bind-key*' form:
;;
;;   (bind-key* "<C-return>" 'other-window)
;;
;; If you want to rebind a key only in a particular keymap, use:
;;
;;   (bind-key "C-c x" 'my-ctrl-c-x-command some-other-mode-map)
;;
;; To unbind a key within a keymap (for example, to stop your favorite major
;; mode from changing a binding that you don't want to override everywhere),
;; use `unbind-key':
;;
;;   (unbind-key "C-c x" some-other-mode-map)
;;
;; To bind multiple keys at once, or set up a prefix map, a
;; `bind-keys' macro is provided.  It accepts keyword arguments, see
;; its documentation for detailed description.
;;
;; To add keys into a specific map, use :map argument
;;
;;    (bind-keys :map dired-mode-map
;;               ("o" . dired-omit-mode)
;;               ("a" . some-custom-dired-function))
;;
;; To set up a prefix map, use :prefix-map and :prefix
;; arguments (both are required)
;;
;;    (bind-keys :prefix-map my-customize-prefix-map
;;               :prefix "C-c c"
;;               ("f" . customize-face)
;;               ("v" . customize-variable))
;;
;; You can combine all the keywords together.
;; Additionally, :prefix-docstring can be specified to set
;; documentation of created :prefix-map variable.
;;
;; To bind multiple keys in a `bind-key*' way (to be sure that your bindings
;; will not be overridden by other modes), you may use `bind-keys*' macro:
;;
;;    (bind-keys*
;;     ("C-o" . other-window)
;;     ("C-M-n" . forward-page)
;;     ("C-M-p" . backward-page))
;;
;; After Emacs loads, you can see a summary of all your personal keybindings
;; currently in effect with this command:
;;
;;   M-x describe-personal-keybindings
;;
;; This display will tell you if you've overriden a default keybinding, and
;; what the default was.  Also, it will tell you if the key was rebound after
;; your binding it with `bind-key', and what it was rebound it to.
