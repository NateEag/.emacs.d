# php-mode

This updates php-mode with features to make it more friendly to use with PHP 5.4 and 5.5.  It is based on the work of:

1. Turadg Aleahmad: The original author.

2. Aaron S. Hawley

3. Lennart Borgman

And all those mentioned in the ‘Contributors’ section below.

Please email any bugs or feature requests to `lobbyjones at gmail dot com` or submit them as Issues on the [Github page](https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode).  Also please include the output of `php-mode-version` in bug reports.

**Note:** [You can see all of the previous changes for each version here.](https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode/blob/master/Changelog.md)

# Status

[The php-mode wiki](https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode/wiki) describes the plan for the next release and I update it to mark off issues when they are complete.  However, there is no hard date set for each release.  Serious bugs I try to resolve as soon as possibe.  But lately I have been lax when it comes to finishing feature requests, so my apologies.  That said, php-mode is in no way a dead project by any means, even if updates are sometimes sparse.

# Features

## New Keywords

Now php-mode supports syntax highlighting for new keywords which were added as part of PHP 5.4, e.g. those related to traits, such as `insteadof`.  Also supported are the older keywords `clone` and `default`.

## Constants

Syntax highlighting includes every magic constant and predefined constant listed on the official PHP site.  However, some constants from specific extensions are not currently included.

## Traits, Interfaces, and Namespaces

Traits, interfaces, and namespaces now appear under Imenu listings. Fontification works properly for namespaces as well, so that code like `namespace Foo\Bar\Baz` no longer looks like a warning.  This is also true for namespace aliases, e.g. `use <namespace> as <alias>`; currently the aliased name is not listed in Imenu, but that will be addressed in the future.

## Treatment of Underscores

Underscores are treated as ‘symbol constituents’ (in Emacs terminology) so that you can use keys like M-f and M-b to move through the individual parts of a variable name like `$foo_bar_baz`.

## Chained Method Calls

A series of method calls over multiple lines will now be aligned with the `->` operator, e.g.:

    $object->foo()
           ->bar()
           ->baz();

## Nested Array Formatting

Nested function calls and `array()` structures now look better by default (or at least in my opinion).  Here is an example of the style:

    $results = Post::model()->find(
        array(
            'select' => 'title',
            'condition' => 'postID=:postID',
            'params' => array(':postID' => 10),
        )
    );

## Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions such as

    $greet = function($name) { … };

will now appear on Imenu; in this case the name will be `$greet`.

## Flymake Support

By customizing the variable `php-executable` you can enable Flymake mode in order to see warnings and errors in real-time as you write code.

## Search Local Documentation

The key command `C-c C-f` will search the PHP website for documentation on the word under the cursor.  However, if you have a [local copy of the PHP documentation](http://us2.php.net/download-docs.php) then php-mode will try searching that documentation first.  All you need to do is customize the variable `php-manual-path` and give it the path to your copy of the documentation.  If php-mode cannot find something locally then it will still fallback on searching the PHP website.

## Executing Regions of PHP

The command `php-send-region`, which is bound to `C-c C-r` by default, will execute the selected region of PHP code.  In conjunction with the Emacs command `C-x h` you can use this to execute an entire file.  Any output will appear in a buffer called `*PHP*`.

## Annotation Highlighting

Projects like [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) use annotations in comments.  For example, here is code from their website:

    /**
     * @ORM\Entity
     * @ORM\Table(name="product")
     */
    class Product
    {
        /**
         * @ORM\Id
         * @ORM\Column(type="integer")
         * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
         */
        protected $id;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="string", length=100)
         */
        protected $name;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="decimal", scale=2)
         */
        protected $price;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="text")
         */
        protected $description;
    }

The annotations are the lines that begin with the `@` character, and php-mode will give these special highlighting to help them stand out.

## Coding Styles

By default php-mode tries to provide a reasonable style for indentation and formatting.  However, it provides other options suited for particular projects which you may find useful.  These coding styles are available through three functions:

1. `php-enable-pear-coding-style`
2. `php-enable-drupal-coding-style`
3. `php-enable-wordpress-coding-style`

They will help format your code for PEAR projects, or work on the Drupal and WordPress software, respectively.  You may enable any of them by default by running `M-x customize-group <RET> php` and looking for the ‘PHP Mode Coding Style’ option.

# How to Contribute

All contributions to php-mode are welcome.  But please try to do the following when sending improvements or bug fixes:

1. Add your name to the list of ‘Contributors’ in this `README.md` file if it is not there already.  If you have a Github page then please link your name to it, so people can see your other work.

2. If your contribution addresses an issue on the Github project page then include a single line like `Github-issue: 16` with the appropriate issue number.

3. Make sure to update the constant `php-mode-modified`.

4. However, please do not modify `php-mode-version-number`.  I will decide what constitutes a bump in the version number.

5. Open the `php-mode-test.el` file and [run all of the tests](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/Running-Tests-Interactively.html#Running-Tests-Interactively) to ensure they still pass as expected.  Sometimes we expect for a test to fail, and those unit tests have the appropriate configuration so their failure will not raise any warnings.  You can use the `run-tests.sh` script to run all tests from a terminal, which is also useful in conjunction with [`git bisect run`](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Debugging-with-Git).

6. Send me a pull request here on Github.  Or if you do not have a Github account then email the patches to me at `lobbyjones at gmail dot com`.  Please try to make sure the patches are acceptable input to the comand `git am`.  Please note that even if you send a pull request it is very likely that I will *not* simply merge your branch through Github; I prefer to go through commits and cherry-pick them so I can review the commit messages and sign-off on them.  You can see which commits I did or did not merge by using the [`git-cherry`](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-cherry.html) command.

If you are fixing a bug related to a Github issue, then first of all, thank you for the help improving php-mode.  Second, there is a `tests/` directory which contains PHP scripts for issues (although not all of them).  Please consider adding a test script to that directory that documents the expected behavior and provides code that allows others to see if said behavior works properly.  Then create a unit test within `php-mode-test.el` using [ERT](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/index.html). Please try to follow the format of the existing tests.

# The Wiki

The Github project page [has a wiki](https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode/wiki) that you should feel free to edit.  The wiki lists the features and bugs that are on plan to include in upcoming versions of php-mode.  It is also a place to add any tips to make the mode more useful.
