============================
Nate Eagleson's Emacs Config
============================

This is my emacs configuration.

There's nothing particularly special or clever about it.

Mostly, I'm making this to get GitHub's recommendation that I create a
readme to go away.

Modes proper go in modes/.

Elisp that's generally useful but aren't exactly modes (think Pymacs) go in libraries/.
