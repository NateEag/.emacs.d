ECMAScript/JavaScript; Defined in RFC 4329 (equivalent to application/ecmascript but with looser processing rules) It is not accepted in IE 8 or earlier - text/javascript is accepted but it is defined as obsolete in RFC 4329. The "type" attribute of the <script> tag in HTML5 is optional. In practice, omitting the media type of JavaScript programs is the most interoperable solution, since all browsers have always assumed the correct default even before HTML5.
