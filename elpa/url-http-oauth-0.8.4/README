url-http-oauth adds OAuth 2.0 support to Emacs's URL library.

Most Recent Improvements
------------------------

New in url-http-oauth 0.8.4, released 2025-06-26

** Register authorization scheme after `url-auth' is loaded.

** Require Emacs 24.4 or newer.

New in url-http-oauth 0.8.3, released 2023-05-10

Warning: To deal with OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens, `url-http-oauth' needs
to delete then rewrite entries in netrc files listed in the
`auth-sources' variable.  The netrc entry rewriting code is new and
relatively untested so please back up these files before trying OAuth
2.0 support.  Entry deletion respects the customization value of
`auth-source-save-behavior'; if it is set to `ask', you will be
prompted before the entry deletion happens.

** Add url-http-oauth-demo.el.

** Validate "client-identifier" setting.

** Autoload public API functions.

** Fix compatibility for older Emacs versions.
