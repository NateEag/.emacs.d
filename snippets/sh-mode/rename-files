# An example of how to batch-rename files in bash based on a pattern. I forget
# this every time I haven't done it in a few months so I figured I should keep
# an example of how to do it, which is one of the main things I use snippets for.
#
# The defaults just show a dumb example of renaming files that start with four
# digits to put a hyphen after the first four.
