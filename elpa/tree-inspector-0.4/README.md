![tree-inspector.png](tree-inspector.png "Tree Inspector")

Works together with the [Emacs Inspector](https://github.com/mmontone/emacs-inspector "Emacs Inspector") when it is loaded; when an object label is clicked on the tree, an inspector is opened on that object.

## Install and usage

`(require 'tree-inspector)` to load.

Then start the inspector with either `M-x tree-inspector-inspect-expression` or `M-x tree-inspector-inspect-last-sexp`.
