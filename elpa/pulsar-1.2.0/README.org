#+vindex: pulse-pulse-functions
#+findex: pulsar-mode
#+findex: pulsar-global-mode
This is a small package that temporarily highlights the current line
after a given function is invoked.  The affected functions are defined
in the user option ~pulsar-pulse-functions~ and the effect takes place
when either ~pulsar-mode~ (buffer-local) or ~pulsar-global-mode~ is
enabled.

#+vindex: pulsar-resolve-pulse-function-aliases
By default, Pulsar does not try to behave the same way for a function's
aliases. If those are not added explicitly to the ~pulsar-pulse-functions~,
they will not have a pulse effect. However, the user option
~pulsar-resolve-pulse-function-aliases~ can be set to a non-nil value
to change this behaviour, meaning that Pulsar will cover a function's
aliases even if those are not explicitly added to the ~pulsar-pulse-functions~.

#+findex: pulsar-pulse-region-functions
Pulsar can also produce an effect over a specific region. This is
useful to, for example, highlight the area covered by text that is
pasted in the buffer. The user option ~pulsar-pulse-region-functions~
defines a list of functions that are region-aware in this regard. The
default value covers copyring, pasting, and undoing/redoing.

#+findex: pulsar-pulse-on-window-change
The pulse effect also happens whenever there is a change to the window
layout. This includes the selection, addition, deletion, resize of
windows in a frame. Users who do not want this to happen can set the
user option ~pulsar-pulse-on-window-change~ to a nil value.

#+vindex: pulsar-delay
#+vindex: pulsar-iterations
#+vindex: pulsar-face
The overall duration of the highlight is determined by a combination of
~pulsar-delay~ and ~pulsar-iterations~.  The latter determines the
number of blinks in a pulse, while the former sets their delay in
seconds before they fade out.  The applicable face is specified in
~pulsar-face~.

#+vindex: pulsar-pulse
To disable the pulse but keep the temporary highlight, set the user
option ~pulsar-pulse~ to nil.  The current line will remain highlighted
until another command is invoked.

#+vindex: pulsar-inhibit-hidden-buffers
The user option ~pulsar-inhibit-hidden-buffers~ controls whether
Pulsar is active in hidden buffers. These are buffers that users
normally do not interact with and are not displayed in the interface
of the various buffer-switching commands. When this user option is
nil, ~pulsar-mode~ will work in those buffers as well.

#+findex: pulsar-pulse-line
#+findex: pulsar-highlight-line
To highlight the current line on demand, use the ~pulsar-pulse-line~
command.  When ~pulsar-pulse~ is non-nil (the default), its highlight
will pulse before fading away.  Whereas the ~pulsar-highlight-line~
command never pulses the line: the highlight stays in place as if
~pulsar-pulse~ is nil.

#+findex: pulsar-pulse-region
The command ~pulsar-pulse-region~ pulses the active region. The effect
of the pulse is controlled by the aforementioned user options, namely,
~pulsar-delay~, ~pulsar-iterations~, ~pulsar-face~.

#+findex: pulsar-highlight-dwim
A do-what-I-mean command is also on offer: ~pulsar-highlight-dwim~.  It
highlights the current line line like ~pulsar-highlight-line~.  If the
region is active, it applies its effect there.  The region may also be a
rectangle (internally they differ from ordinary regions).

#+vindex: pulsar-highlight-face
To help users differentiate between the pulse and highlight effects, the
user option ~pulsar-highlight-face~ controls the presentation of the
~pulsar-highlight-line~ and ~pulsar-highlight-dwim~ commands.  By
default, this variable is the same as ~pulsar-face~.

Pulsar depends on the built-in ~pulse.el~ library.

Why the name "pulsar"?  It sounds like "pulse" and is a recognisable
word.  Though if you need a backronym, consider "Pulsar Unquestionably
Luminates, Strictly Absent the Radiation".

** Convenience functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6ca69953-1a89-4968-a46c-2fa5e57aca9b
:END:

Depending on the user's workflow, there may be a need for differently
colored pulses.  These are meant to provide an ad-hoc deviation from the
standard style of the command ~pulsar-pulse-line~ (which is governed by
the user option ~pulsar-face~).  Pulsar thus provides the following for
the user's convenience:

#+findex: pulsar-pulse-line-red
- ~pulsar-pulse-line-red~

#+findex: pulsar-pulse-line-green
- ~pulsar-pulse-line-green~

#+findex: pulsar-pulse-line-yellow
- ~pulsar-pulse-line-yellow~

#+findex: pulsar-pulse-line-blue
- ~pulsar-pulse-line-blue~

#+findex: pulsar-pulse-line-magenta
- ~pulsar-pulse-line-magenta~

#+findex: pulsar-pulse-line-cyan
- ~pulsar-pulse-line-cyan~

These can be called with =M-x=, assigned to a hook and/or key binding,
or be incorporated in custom functions.

* Installation

** GNU ELPA package
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:916cf31a-8f25-472e-9328-9c47522f1dd4
:END:

The package is available as ~pulsar~.  Simply do:

: M-x package-refresh-contents
: M-x package-install

And search for it.

GNU ELPA provides the latest stable release.  Those who prefer to follow
the development process in order to report bugs or suggest changes, can
use the version of the package from the GNU-devel ELPA archive.  Read:
https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-05-13-emacs-elpa-devel/.

** Manual installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:389e5e2f-5bb9-4be4-9a9c-0dbeeecccc54
:END:

Assuming your Emacs files are found in =~/.emacs.d/=, execute the
following commands in a shell prompt:

#+begin_src sh
cd ~/.emacs.d

# Create a directory for manually-installed packages
mkdir manual-packages

# Go to the new directory
cd manual-packages

# Clone this repo, naming it "pulsar"
git clone https://github.com/protesilaos/pulsar pulsar
#+end_src

Finally, in your =init.el= (or equivalent) evaluate this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Make Elisp files in that directory available to the user.
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/manual-packages/pulsar")
#+end_src

Everything is in place to set up the package.

* Sample configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:96289426-8480-4ea6-9053-280348adc0ed
:END:
#+cindex: Package configuration

Remember to read the doc string of each of these variables.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'pulsar)

;; Check the default value of `pulsar-pulse-functions'.  That is where
;; you add more commands that should cause a pulse after they are
;; invoked

(setq pulsar-pulse t)
(setq pulsar-delay 0.055)
(setq pulsar-iterations 10)
(setq pulsar-face 'pulsar-magenta)
(setq pulsar-highlight-face 'pulsar-yellow)

(pulsar-global-mode 1)

;; OR use the local mode for select mode hooks

(dolist (hook '(org-mode-hook emacs-lisp-mode-hook))
  (add-hook hook #'pulsar-mode))

;; pulsar does not define any key bindings.  This is just a sample that
;; respects the key binding conventions.  Evaluate:
;;
;;     (info "(elisp) Key Binding Conventions")
;;
;; The author uses C-x l for `pulsar-pulse-line' and C-x L for
;; `pulsar-highlight-line'.
;;
;; You can replace `pulsar-highlight-line' with the command
;; `pulsar-highlight-dwim'.
(let ((map global-map))
  (define-key map (kbd "C-c h p") #'pulsar-pulse-line)
  (define-key map (kbd "C-c h h") #'pulsar-highlight-line))
#+end_src

** Use pulsar with next-error
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:0b055c04-fefe-4355-9951-a74689c8d1e5
:END:

By default, the =n= and =p= keys in Emacs' compilation buffers (e.g. the
results of a ~grep~ search) produce a highlight for the locus of the
given match.  Due to how the code is implemented, we cannot use Pulsar's
standard mechanism to trigger a pulse after the match is highlighted.
Instead, the user must add this to their configuration in lieu of a
Pulsar-level solution that "just works":

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'next-error-hook #'pulsar-pulse-line)
#+end_src

** Use pulsar in the minibuffer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:8b942448-6ed3-4cb7-8e31-796a8c5011a6
:END:

Due to how the minibuffer works, the user cannot rely on the user
option ~pulse-pulse-functions~ to automatically pulse in that context.
Instead, the user must add a function to the ~minibuffer-setup-hook~:
it will trigger a pulse as soon as the minibuffer shows up:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'pulsar-pulse-line)
#+end_src

The ~pulsar-pulse-line~ function will use the default Pulsar face, per
the user option ~pulsar-face~.

A convenience function can also be used ([[#h:6ca69953-1a89-4968-a46c-2fa5e57aca9b][Convenience functions]]).  The
idea is to apply a different color than the one applied by default.
For example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'pulsar-pulse-line-blue)
#+end_src

* Integration with other packages
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b884f2ac-82f3-48c0-bee5-6709d6647b1d
:END:
#+cindex: Helper functions for integration with other packages

Beside ~pulsar-pulse-line~, Pulsar defines a few functions that can be
added to hooks that are provided by other packages.

#+findex: pulsar-recenter-top
#+findex: pulsar-recenter-center
#+findex: pulsar-recenter-middle
There are two functions to recenter and then pulse the current line:
~pulsar-recenter-top~ and ~pulsar-recenter-center~ (alias
~pulsar-recenter-middle~).

#+findex: pulsar-reveal-entry
There also exists ~pulsar-reveal-entry~ which displays the hidden
contents of an Org or Outline heading.  It can be used in tandem with
the aforementioned recentering functions.

Example use-cases:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; integration with the `consult' package:
(add-hook 'consult-after-jump-hook #'pulsar-recenter-top)
(add-hook 'consult-after-jump-hook #'pulsar-reveal-entry)

;; integration with the built-in `imenu':
(add-hook 'imenu-after-jump-hook #'pulsar-recenter-top)
(add-hook 'imenu-after-jump-hook #'pulsar-reveal-entry)
#+end_src

     <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
