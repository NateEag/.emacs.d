;; In recent times, a vicious beast known only as the "Unicode troll" has risen
;; from the abyss, wielding his fearsome tool, the Unicode homoglyph. Looking
;; nearly identical to common ASCII characters, the homoglyphs hide in code,
;; lying in wait for an unsuspecting programmer to devour whole without warning.
;;
;; Don't be the next victim. Enable `unicode-troll-stopper-mode' and force these
;; vicious beasts from the shadows in which they lurk.
