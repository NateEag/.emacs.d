# Insert a bash trap that should execute when the script is terminated,
# interrupted, or invokes exit with a non-zero status itself.
#
# Thus, this provides a much more robust idiom for handling cleanup actions
# than manually doing it throughout the script.
#
# Make sure to invoke the function at the bottom of the script too. I used to
# include EXIT, but recently realized that causes the trap to run twice.
