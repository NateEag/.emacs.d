;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Khalel provides helper routines to import upcoming events from a local
;;  calendar through the command-line tool khal into an org-mode file. Commands
;;  to edit and to capture new events allow modifications to the calendar.
;;  Changes to the local calendar can be transfered to remote CalDAV servers
;;  using the command-line tool vdirsyncer which can be called from within
;;  khalel.
;;
;;  First steps/quick start:
;;  - install, configure and run vdirsyncer
;;  - install and configure khal
;;  - customize the values for default calendar, capture file and import file for khalel
;;  - call `khalel-add-capture-template' to set up a capture template
;;  - import upcoming events through `khalel-import-upcoming-events',
;;    edit them through `khalel-edit-calendar-event' or create new ones through `org-capture'
;;  - consider adding the import org file to your org agenda to show upcoming events there
;;

(defun khalel-import-upcoming-events ()
  "Imports future calendar entries by calling khal externally.

The time delta which determines how far into the future events
are imported is configured through `khalel-import-time-delta'.
CAUTION: The results are imported into the file
`khalel-import-org-file' which is overwritten to avoid adding
duplicate entries already imported previously. As default, the
file is configured to be read-only. This can be adjusted by
configuring `khalel-import-org-file-read-only'.

Please note that the resulting org file does not necessarily
include all information contained in the .ics files it is based
on. Khal only supports certain (basic) fields when creating lists.

Examples of missing fields are timezone information, categories,
alarms or settings for repeating events."
