Tests
=====

This directory contains tests for PHP Mode.  Each test begins with a
comment header explaining the purpose of the test and a link to the
relative [Github issue][github].  The main purpose of these tests are
to demonstrate whether or not features like syntax highlighting and
indentation work properly.  Because of that, executing most of the
tests is not important, since we do not care about how PHP itself
interprets the test scripts.  We only care about how Emacs and
PHP Mode formats the code within each test.

Please use the file `tests/template.php` as a start when creating new
tests cases.
