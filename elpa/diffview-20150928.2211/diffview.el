;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Render a unified diff (top/bottom) in an easy-to-comprehend side-by-side
;; format.  This comes in handy for reading patches from mailing lists (or
;; from whencever you might acquire them).
;;
;;; Installation:
;;
;;     M-x package-install diffview
;;
;;; Usage:
;;
;; The following functions are provided for launching a side-by-side diff:
;;
;; o `diffview-current' : View the current diff buffer side-by-side
;; o `diffview-region' : View the current diff region side-by-side
;; o `diffview-message' : View the current email message (which presumably
;;    contains a patch) side-by-side
;;
