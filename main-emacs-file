;; Nate Eagleson's .emacs file.

;; Just symlink ~/.emacs to ~/.emacs.d/main-emacs-file, and I should be good
;; to go.

;; This is the first import, so there's probably some dumb stuff in here.
;; I've never taken Emacs all that seriously up to this point - I've finally
;; decided to buckle down and start using it semi-seriously.

;; If, for some reason, you've found a copy of this and would like to speak
;; to the creator (for instance, to point out much more elegant and correct
;; ways of doing things), try nate@ishness.net.

;; Note that I use aquamacs, so if I ever have to move to a different
;; emacs distribution, I'll have to be certain to pull the non-Aquamacs
;; modifications I've made from the Aquamacs preferences.el file (stored
;; somewhere in the ~/Library directory on OS X).

;; Customized keybindings follow.

;; I like autocompleting things, but I don't like Meta-/ as a keystroke.
;; Meta-RET, which is apparently what that mess down there means, is better,
;; though ideally, I think I'd like it to be Control-RET. That binding, though,
;; seems to be nearly impossible for me to get, so for now I'll not have it.
;; DEBUG I should really move to one of those clever does-it-all Tab functions,
;; but this is here for the moment.

;; The next few chunks of code tell a long, sad story about my relationship
;; with ASCII character 9 (a.k.a the Tab character). Once, we were the closest
;; of friends, but one day, I decided I hated it... Thus, the current
;; incarnation of my .emacs file. The goal is to ensure that it never occurs
;; in any source file I edit.
