;;; Commentary:

;; Edit YAML files for Ansible containing embedded Jinja2 templating.
;;
;; This is a polymode, gluing jinja2-mode into either yaml-mode or
;; yaml-ts-mode.  If you usually use yaml-ts-mode to edit YAML files,
;; then that mode will be used as the host mode; otherwise, yaml-mode
;; will be used.  In either case, minor modes ansible-mode and
;; ansible-doc-mode are both also activated.
;;
;; Also included is poly-systemd-jinja2-mode, a polymode gluing
;; jinja2-mode into systemd-mode, for when you’re using templates to
;; create Systemd unit configurations.
;;
;; Aside: Although yaml-ts-mode is built in to Emacs, as of version 29
;; it is missing basic features compared to yaml-mode (such as
;; indentation).  It also requires the separate installation of the
;; tree-sitter-yaml Tree-sitter parser (either via your operating
;; system’s package manager, via treesit-auto, or manually).
