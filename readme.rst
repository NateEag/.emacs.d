============================
Nate Eagleson's Emacs Config
============================

I have a love/hate relationship with Emacs.

On the one hand, its user interface is obscurantist at best, the default
install is incredibly heavyweight, and it has never made the leap to working
well in a graphical environment.

On the other hand, it is Turing-complete, it has been polished over decades to
be an extraordinarily powerful programmer's editor, I can use it on almost any
platform, and I can evolve it to work exactly the way I want it to.

In short, "Emacs is a terrible text editor, but a wonderful operating system."

It's not too far from true, and ever since the fateful day Dr. Thang Bui
told his C++ programming class that we should use emacs to edit text files on
the machines in the Sun lab, Emacs has been my editor.

I only really buckled down to start using it semi-seriously around 2009,
so I'm not that far along the curve yet.

Still, you may find a few useful things in here. If you have a moment, glance
at todo.txt and send me the two-line patches that address desires I didn't know
Emacs already had built-in. I've found some of those myself, and wouldn't mind
finding more.
