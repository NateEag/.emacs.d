    "Input exporter specifications.
     This is an alist of elements of the form (id regexp doc
     commmand) or (id . selector). ID is the unique identifier of
     the spec. REGEXP is a regexp which, if matched on current
     file name, implies that the current file can be exported
     with this specification. DOC is a short help string shown
     during interactive export. COMMAND is the exporter
     command (string). It can contain the following format specs:

         %i - input file (no dir)
         %I - input file (full path)
         %o - output file (no dir)
         %O - output file (full path)
         %b - output file (base name only)
         %t - 4th element of the :to spec

     When specification is of the form (id . selector), SELECTOR
     is a function of variable arguments that accepts at least
     one argument ACTION. ACTION is a symbol and can be one of
     the following:

         match - must return non-nil if this specification
             applies to the file that current buffer is visiting,
             or :nomatch if specification does not apply. This
             selector can receive an optional file-name
             argument. In that case the decision must be made
             solely on that file and current buffer must be
             ignored. This is useful for matching exporters to
             weavers when exported file does not exist yet.

         regexp - return a string which is used to match input
             file name. If nil, `match' selector must return
             non-nil value. This selector is ignored if `match'
             returned non-nil.

         doc - return documentation string

         commmand - return a string with optional %i, %f,
             etc. format specs as described above. It will be
             passed to the processing :function.")

    "Output specifications alist. Each element is either a list
     of the form (id ext doc t-spec) or a cons (id . selector).

     In the former case EXT is an extension of the output
     file. DOC is a short documentation string. t-spec is a
     string what is substituted instead of %t in :from spec
     commmand. `t-spec' can be a list of one element '(command),
     in which case the whole :from spec command is substituted
     with command from %t-spec.

     When specification is of the form (id . selector), SELECTOR
     is a function of variable arguments that accepts at least
     one argument ACTION. This function is called in a buffer
     visiting input file. ACTION is a symbol and can one of the
     following:

         output-file - return an output file name or a list of file
           names. Receives input-file as argument. If this
           command returns nil, the output is built from input
           file and value of 'output-ext command.


           This selector can also return a function. This
           function will be called in the callback or sentinel of
           the weaving process after the weaving was
           completed. This function should sniff the output of
           the process for errors or file names. It must return a
           file name, a list of file names or nil if no such
           files have been detected.

         ext - extension of output file. If nil and
           `output' also returned nil, the exporter won't be able
           to identify the output file and no automatic display
           or preview will be available.

         doc - return documentation string

         command - return a string to be used instead of
           the :from command. If nil, :from spec command is used.

         t-spec - return a string to be substituted as %t :from
           spec in :from command. If `command' selector returned
           non-nil, this spec is ignored.")

When FROM or TO are missing they are determined automatically
from the current exporter's specifications and file's
extension. If no appropriate export specification has been found,
look into current weaver and try to match weaver's output to
exporters input extension. When such combination is possible,
settle on weaving first and exporting the weaved output. When
none of the above worked, ask the user for `from' and `to' specs.
