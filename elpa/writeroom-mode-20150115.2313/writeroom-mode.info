1 Writeroom-mode
****************

`writeroom-mode' is a minor mode for Emacs that implements a
distraction-free writing mode similar to the famous Writeroom editor
for OS X. `writeroom-mode' is meant for GNU Emacs 24, lower versions
are not actively supported.

1.1 Installation
================

`writeroom-mode' can be installed through the package manager from
Melpa (http://melpa.org/). If installing manually, make sure to also
install `visual-fill-column'.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Usage,  Next: Customisation,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Writeroom-mode

1.2 Usage
=========

`writeroom-mode' can be activated in a buffer by calling `M-x
writeroom-mode RET'. By default, `writeroom-mode' does the following
things:

   * activate fullscreen

   * disable transparency

   * disable the menu bar

   * disable the tool bar

   * disable the scroll bar

   * maximise the current window (i.e., delete all other windows in the
     frame)

   * disable the fringes

   * disable the mode line

   * add window margins to the current buffer so that the text is 80
     characters wide

The last three effects are buffer-local. The other effects apply to the
current frame. Because `writeroom-mode' is a minor mode, this isn't
entirely on the up and up, since minor modes aren't supposed to have
such global effects. But `writeroom-mode' is meant for distraction-free
writing, so these effects do make sense.

There are some more options that are disabled by default but can be
enabled in the customisation buffer.

1.3.1 Global Writeroom Mode
---------------------------

Activate this option to automatically turn on `writeroom-mode' in any
buffer that has one of the major modes in `writeroom-major-modes'.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Border Width,  Next: Disable Fringe,  Prev: Global Writeroom Mode,  Up: Customisation

1.3.2 Border Width
------------------

Width of the border around the text area. Disabled by default, see
`writeroom-global-effects' to enable the border.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Disable Fringe,  Next: Extra Line Spacing,  Prev: Border Width,  Up: Customisation

1.3.3 Disable Fringe
--------------------

Disable left and right fringes.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Extra Line Spacing,  Next: Fullscreen Effect,  Prev: Disable Fringe,  Up: Customisation

1.3.4 Extra Line Spacing
------------------------

Increase the line spacing. Can be an absolute value (the number of
pixels to add to the line) or a number relative to the default line
height. Disabled by default.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Fullscreen Effect,  Next: Global Effects,  Prev: Extra Line Spacing,  Up: Customisation

1.3.5 Fullscreen Effect
-----------------------

Effect to apply when `writeroom-mode' activates fullscreen. Can be
`fullboth', which uses the entire screen (i.e., window decorations are
disabled and the window manager's panel or task bar is covered by the
Emacs frame) or `maximized', in which case the Emacs frame is maximised
but keeps its window decorations and does not cover the panel.

1.3.6 Global Effects
--------------------

List of global effects:

   * fullscreen

   * transparency

   * scroll bar

   * menu bar

   * tool bar

   * border (add a border around the text area; disabled by default)

Each option can be enabled or disabled individually.

1.3.7 Major Modes
-----------------

List of major modes in which `writeroom-mode' should be activated
automatically. Use in conjunction with `global-writeroom-mode'.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Maximize Window,  Next: Mode Line,  Prev: Major Modes,  Up: Customisation

1.3.8 Maximize Window
---------------------

Maximise the current window in its frame, i.e., delete all other
windows.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Mode Line,  Next: Restore Window Config,  Prev: Maximize Window,  Up: Customisation

1.3.9 Mode Line
---------------

Mode line format to use. By default, the mode line is disabled, but
this option can be used to re-enable it. Either use the default mode
line, or a customised mode line. The latter defaults to showing only
the buffer's name and its modified status, but this can be customised.
See the doc string for `mode-line-format' for options.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Restore Window Config,  Next: Width,  Prev: Mode Line,  Up: Customisation

1.3.10 Restore Window Config
----------------------------

Restore the window configuration that existed before `writeroom-mode'
was activated. This is primarily useful if you use `writeroom-mode' in
only a single buffer, since the window configuration that is restored
is the one that existed at the moment when `writeroom-mode' is called
for the first time. Disabled by default.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Width,  Prev: Restore Window Config,  Up: Customisation

1.3.11 Width
------------

Width of the text area. Can be specified as an absolute value (number
of characters) or as a fraction of the total window width (in which
case it should be a number between 0 and 1).

1.4 Multiple writeroom-mode buffers
===================================

It is possible to activate `writeroom-mode' in more than one buffer.
The global effects are of course activated only once and they remain
active until `writeroom-mode' is deactivated in _all_ buffers.
Alternatively, if you use `writeroom-mode' in multiple buffers with
particular major modes (e.g., `text-mode', `markdown-mode'), you can
use the global minor mode `global-writeroom-mode'. This function
enables the global effects and activates the buffer-local effects in
all (current and future) buffers that have a major mode listed in the
user option `writeroom-major-modes' (by default only `text-mode').

When `global-writeroom-mode' is active, the function `writeroom-mode'
can still be called to enable or disable `writeroom-mode' in individual
buffers (regardless of their major mode, of course). Calling
`global-writeroom-mode' again disables `writeroom-mode' in all buffers
in which it is active, also those in which it was activated manually.

1.5 Adding global effects
=========================

It is possible to define your own global effects and have them
activated automatically when `writeroom-mode' is activated. For
example, you may want to add your own font or colour effects, or
replace the default fullscreen function with one that works in an older
Emacs version. To do this, write a function that takes one argument and
that activates the effect when this argument is `t' and deactivates it
when it is `nil'. Then add this function to the user option
`writeroom-global-effects' by checking the box "Custom effects" and
adding the function to the list.
