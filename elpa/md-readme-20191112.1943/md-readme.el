;;; Commentary:

;; The git-based source code hosting site <http://github.com> has
;; lately become popular for Emacs Lisp projects. Github has a feature
;; that displays files named "README[.suffix]" automatically on a
;; project's main page. If these files are formatted in Markdown, the
;; formatting is interpreted. See
;; <http://github.com/guides/readme-formatting> for more information.

;; Emacs Lisp files customarily have a header in a fairly standardized
;; format. md-readme extracts this header, re-formats it to Markdown,
;; and writes it to the file "README.md" in the same directory. If you
;; put your code on github, you could have this run automatically, for
;; instance upon saving the file or from a git pre-commit hook, so you
;; always have an up-to-date README on github.

;; It recognizes headings, the GPL license disclaimer which is
;; replaced by a shorter notice linking to the GNU project's license
;; website, lists, and normal paragraphs. It escapes `backtick-quoted'
;; names so they will display correctly. Lists are somewhat tricky to
;; recognize automatically, and the program employs a very simple
;; heuristic currently.

;;; Dependencies:
;; None.

;;; Installation:
;; (require 'md-readme), then you can call mdr-generate manually. I
;; have not found a way to call it automatically that I really like,
;; but here is one that works for me:

;;     (require 'md-readme)
;;     (dir-locals-set-class-variables
;;      'generate-README-with-md-readme
;;      '((emacs-lisp-mode . ((mdr-generate-readme . t)))))
;;     (dolist (dir '("~/Projects/wpmail/" "~/Projects/md-readme/"))
;;       (dir-locals-set-directory-class
;;        dir 'generate-README-with-md-readme))
;;     (add-hook 'after-save-hook
;;               '(lambda () (if (boundp 'mdr-generate-readme) (mdr-generate))))

;;; Binaries
;; `bin/md-readme` is a shell script that will generate readme.md for the
;; passed file. See it for usage instructions.

;; 2009-11:    First release.
