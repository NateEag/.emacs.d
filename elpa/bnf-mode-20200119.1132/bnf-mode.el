;;; Commentary:

;;   GNU Emacs major mode for editing BNF grammars.  Currently this mode
;; provides basic syntax and font-locking for BNF files.  BNF notation is
;; supported exactly form as it was first announced in the ALGOL 60 report.
;;
;; When developing this mode, the following documents were taken into account:
;;
;; - RFC822: Standard for ARPA Internet Text Messages
;;   (see URL `https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt')
;; - RFC5234: Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF
;;   (see URL `https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5234.txt')
;; - FRC7405: Case-Sensitive String Support in ABNF
;;   (see URL `https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7405.txt')
;; - Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60
;;   (see URL `https://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm')
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; The recommended way is to use ELPA (see URL `https://elpa.gnu.org'),
;; MELPA (see URL `https://melpa.org') or MELPA Stable
;; (see URL `https://stable.melpa.org').  If either is in your
;; `package-archives', do:
;;
;;   M-x package-install RET bnf-mode RET
;;
;; To learn on how to use any other installation methods refer to relevant
;; documentation.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; To toggle the mode in the current buffer:
;;
;;   M-x bnf-mode RET
;;
;; By default any file that matches the glob *.bnf is automatically opened
;; in `bnf-mode'.
;;
;; Customization:
;;
;; To customize various options, use command as follows:
;;
;;   M-x customize-group bnf RET
;;
;; Bugs:
;;
;; Bug tracking is currently handled using the GitHub issue tracker
;; (see URL `https://github.com/sergeyklay/bnf-mode/issues')
;;
;; History:
;;
;; History is tracked in the Git repository rather than in this file.
