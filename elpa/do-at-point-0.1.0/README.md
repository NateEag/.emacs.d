Dispatch Context Sensitive Commands
===================================

Find here the source for do-at-point.el and the command `do-at-point`,
that uses `thing-at-point` to cycle through various "things" to select
and then dispatch appropriate actions on these selections.

See also Omar Antol√≠n Camarena's [Embark] package, which provides a
more feature-full implementation of the same concept, with am emphasis
on interacting with the minibuffer.
