;;; ne-smart-dash-hacks.el --- Some hacky extensions to smart-dash-mode.

;;; Author: Nate Eagleson

;;; Version: 0.0.1

;;; Commentary:

;; smart-dash-mode is awesome, but sometimes you need just a little more smarts
;; in a mode about when it should be active.
;;
;; Hence this thing.

;;; Code:

(defun ne-smart-dash-hacks-sh-mode-should-use-smart-dash ()
  ;; Check if we're in a bash var using thing-at-point-looking-at. If we're
  ;; not, then there's no need to use smart-dash.
  ;;
  ;; For a robust solution you would need a bash parser. I'm just trying to get
  ;; by on hardcoding a few special cases.
  (let ((bash-var-chars "[a-zA-Z0-9_]+"))

    ;; If it contains dashes already, you probably shouldn't underscore.
    (and (not (thing-at-point-looking-at "[a-zA-Z0-9]+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+"))
         ;; However, if it doesn't, there may be several good reasons *to* use
         ;; underscores...
         (or
          ;; Handle export statements.
          ;;
          ;; FIXME Stop using smart-dashes while typing the assignment. I don't
          ;; use the export-while-assigning feature of bash much, so this
          ;; shouldn't get in my way much.
          (thing-at-point-looking-at (concat "\\(export[[:space:]]+\\)?"
                                             bash-var-chars
                                             "\\(=[^[:space:]]*\\)?"))

          ;; Handle vanilla variable assignments. It only works for typing new
          ;; vars if you start with '=' then stick the varname in before it,
          ;; which is why ne-smart-dash-hacks-sh-mode-insert exists. You have
          ;; to do something like that, though, if you want dashes to be used
          ;; in command names, because otherwise you can't distinguish between
          ;; "I am typing a command" and "I am typing a variable name."
          (thing-at-point-looking-at (concat "[[:space]]" bash-var-chars "*="))

          (thing-at-point-looking-at (concat "\\${?" bash-var-chars))
          ;; If thing-at-point has an underscore in it, we should probably keep
          ;; using underscores. Generally, bash commands and inputs lean
          ;; towards dashes, but sometimes they have underscores. I have seen a
          ;; convention where tab completion functions begin with an underscore
          ;; then use dashes everywhere else, so their names align with the
          ;; command they offer completion for, which is why this doesn't
          ;; accept an underscore as the first character.
          (thing-at-point-looking-at "[:space:]+[a-zA-Z0-9]+_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*")))))

;; TODO Maybe snippetize this, so it's easy to write the assignment half once
;; you've typed your varname?
(defun ne-smart-dash-hacks-sh-mode-insert ()

  ;; FIXME Add the hack function to ac-trigger-commands-on-completing, so
  ;; typing underscore with it doesn't terminate completion. For the moment I
  ;; just put it in custom.el.
