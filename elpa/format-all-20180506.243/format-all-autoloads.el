(autoload 'format-all-buffer "format-all" "\
Auto-format the source code in the current buffer.

No disk files are touched - the buffer doesn't even need to be
saved.  If you don't like the results of the formatting, you can
use ordinary undo to get your code back to its previous state.

You will need to install external programs to do the formatting.
If the command can't find the program that it needs, it will try
to tell you how you might be able to install it on your operating
system.  Only Emacs Lisp is formatted without an external program.

A suitable formatter is selected according to the `major-mode' of
the buffer.  Many popular programming languages are supported,
but not all of them by any means, so unfortunately it's still
likely that your favorite language is missing.  It is fairly easy
to add new languages that have an external formatter.

Any errors/warnings encountered during formatting are shown in a
buffer called *format-all-errors*.  If the formatter made any
changes to the code, point is placed at the first change.
