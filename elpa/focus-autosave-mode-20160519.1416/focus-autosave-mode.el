;;; Commentary:

;; `focus-autosave-mode' is a global minor mode saving every modified
;; file when the Emacs frame loses its focus.

;; `focus-autosave-local-mode' is a buffer-local version of this mode.

;; Currently there is no way to exclude some buffers from the global version.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

(defvar focus-autosave-buffer-list nil
  "A list of buffers to be saved on focus-out.")

(defcustom focus-autosave-local-action nil
  "A shell command or Elisp function to run after saving the
buffer. Do nothing if `nil'"
  :risky t)
(make-local-variable 'focus-autosave-local-action)
