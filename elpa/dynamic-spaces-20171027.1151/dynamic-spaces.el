;;; Commentary:

;; When editing a text, and `dynamic-spaces-mode' is enabled, text
;; separated by more than one space doesn't move, if possible.
;; Concretely, end-of-line comments stay in place when you edit the
;; code and you can edit a field in a table without affecting other
;; fields.
;;
;; For example, this is the content of a buffer before an edit (where
;; `*' represents the cursor):
;;
;;     alpha*gamma         delta
;;     one two             three
;;
;; When inserting "beta" without dynamic spaces, the result would be:
;;
;;     alphabeta*gamma         delta
;;     one two             three
;;
;; However, with `dynamic-spaces-mode' enabled the result becomes:
;;
;;     alphabeta*gamma     delta
;;     one two             three

;; Usage:
;;
;; To enable *dynamic spaces* for all supported modes, add the
;; following to a suitable init file:
;;
;;     (dynamic-spaces-global-mode 1)
;;
;; Or, activate it for a specific major mode:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'example-mode-hook 'dynamic-spaces-mode)
;;
;; Alternatively, use `M-x customize-group RET dynamic-spaces RET'.

;; Space groups:
;;
;; Two pieces of text are considered different (and
;; `dynamic-spaces-mode' tries to keep then in place) if they are
;; separated by a "space group".  The following is, by default,
;; considered space groups:
;;
;; * A TAB character.
;;
;; * Two or more whitespace characters.
;;
;; However, the following are *not* considered space groups:
;;
;; * whitespace in a quoted string.
;;
;; * Two spaces, when preceded by a punctuation character and
;;   `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil.
;;
;; * Two spaces, when preceded by a colon and `colon-double-space' is
;;   non-nil.

;; Configuration:
;;
;; You can use the following variables to modify the behavior or
;; `dynamic-spaces-mode':
;;
;; * `dynamic-spaces-mode-list' - List of major modes where
;;   dynamic spaces mode should be enabled by the global mode.
;;
;; * `dynamic-spaces-avoid-mode-list' - List of major modes where
;;   dynamic spaces mode should not be enabled.
;;
;; * `dynamic-spaces-global-mode-ignore-buffer' - When non-nil in a
;;   buffer, `dynamic-spaces-mode' will not be enabled in that buffer
;;   when `dynamic-spaces-global-mode' is enabled.
;;
;; * `dynamic-spaces-commands' - Commands that dynamic spaces mode
;;   should adjust spaces for.
;;
;; * `dynamic-spaces-keys' - Keys, in `kbd' format, that dynamic
;;   spaces mode should adjust spaces for.  (This is needed as many
;;   major modes define electric command and bind them to typical edit
;;   keys.)
;;
;; * `dynamic-spaces-find-next-space-group-function' - A function that
;;   would find the next dynamic space group.

;; Notes:
;;
;; By default, this is disabled for org-mode since it interferes with
;; the org mode table edit system.
