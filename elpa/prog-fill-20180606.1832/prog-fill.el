;;; Commentary:

;; Have you ever hated having really long chained method calls in heavy OOP
;; languages? or just enjoy avoiding hitting the 80 column margin in any others?
;;
;; If so, this is the mode for you!
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;; Imagine coming across this mess - who wants to try to mentally parse that
;; out?
;;
;;     $this->setBlub((Factory::get('some-thing', 'with-args'))->inner())->withChained(1, 2, 3);
;;
;; Hit M-q on the line (after binding it to `prog-fill' for that mode) and it
;; becomes:
;;
;;     $this
;;         ->setBlub(
;;             (Factory::get(
;;                 'some-thing',
;;                 'with-args'))
;;             ->inner())
;;         ->withChained(
;;             1,
;;             2,
;;             3);
;;
;; Or maybe you've got a crazy javasript promise chain you're working on?
;;
;;     superagent.get(someUrl).then(response => response.body).catch(reason => console.log(reason))
;;
;; Again, press M-q on the line and it becomes:
;;
;;     superagent.get(someUrl)
;;       .then(response => response.body)
;;       .catch(reason => console.log(reason))
